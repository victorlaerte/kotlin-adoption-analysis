Unfortunately, I did it by renaming and moving the source folders rather than refactoring through Android Studio, which was a bad idea. I've been searching for a solution to this problem all day, and these are the things I have tried to no avail: Doing a Gradle sync; Reinstalling Java JRE and Java SDK; Reinstalling the latest version of Android Studio (1.4); Rolling back to the previous AS version (1.3); Invalidating the AS cache and restarting; Deleting the and directories in the project directory; Deleting the directory in my user directory; Running from the AS terminal; Manually copying the sources over to a new project (weird that it somehow persists across projects...) Things that I've tried with a little success, but only let me perform one more clean and rebuild before the error occurs again: Closing AS, manually deleting the build files and opening it again; Killing the process while AS is running (this could technically be done every time, but it's tedious and slows down the build process) So it seems that compile the Java process may put a lock on the build files for some reason, but it might also be something to do with Kotlin. I have a (more mature) Java Android project that I'm working on, though I can't reproduce this error when cleaning it. It seems to only happen to my Kotlin project. Any ideas? Thanks in advance. Update: I've found that the problem is being caused by the Kotlin Android plugin. The problem disappears when I remove from the module's file and comes back when I reinsert it. Feel free to offer any insight into this. Update 2: The last update isn't the cause. I found that if a project contains a Kotlin file then rebuilding and cleaning fails. It continues to fail, even if all the Kotlin files are removed, until the background Java process is killed, meaning it has some kind of lock on the build files.

"Fragment instance is retained but child fragment is not re-attached"," Update: accepted answer points to explanation (bug) with a work-around, but also see my Kotlin based work-around attached as an answer below. This code is in Kotlin, but I think it is a basic android fragment life-cycle issue. I have a Fragment that holds a reference to an other \"subfragment\" Here is basically what I am doing: I have a main fragment that has set to true I have a field in the main fragment that will hold a reference to the subfragment, initially this field is null In the main fragment's , I check to see if the subfragment field is null, if so, I create an instance of the subFragment and assign it to the field Finally I add the subfragment to a container in the layout of the main fragment. If the field is not null, ie we are in onCreateView due to a configuration change, I don't re-create the subfragment, I just try to added it to the containter. When the device is rotated, I do observe the and methods of the subfragment being called, but I don't see any lifecyle methods being called on the subfragment during the process of adding the retained reference to the subfragment, to the child_container when the main fragments view is re-created. The net affect is that I don't see the subfragment view in the main fragment. If I comment out the if (subfragment == null) and just create a new subfragment everytime, i do see the subfragment in the view. Update The answer below does point out a bug, in which the childFragmentManager is not retained on configuration changes. This will ultimately break my intended usage, which was to preserve the backstack after rotation, however I think what I am seeing is something different. I added code to the activities method and I see something like this when the app is first launched: and then after rotation: here fm is the childFragmentManager, and as you can see, we still have the same instance of Tab1Fragment, but it has a new childFragmentManager, which I think is unwanted and due to the bug reported in the answer below. The thing is that I did add the subfragment to this new childFragmentManger. So it seems like the transaction never executes with the reference to the fragment that was retained, but does complete if I create a brand new fragment. (I did try calling on the new childFragmentManager) "

"Unresolved reference to debug directory in kotlin library module"," I'm using Kotlin for the first time to develop an Android app. Currently I'm working on a library module (\"data\") inside my project, separate from the main app module: I've come across a snag: whenever a file inside data.src.main references a file inside data.src.debug, the build process fails with the message \"Unresolved reference: [class name]\". However, it doesn't fail when I reference files inside data.src.release. In both cases I've triple checked the syntax, directories, and build variants. I haven't modified the debug or release build types inside my build.gradle files - I'm using whatever their default settings are. My source sets are: The module is using the 'com.android.library' and 'kotlin-android' plugins. All the files I've tested with so far have been Kotlin files, though I don't know if this is a Kotlin issue or something else. Kotlin has otherwise been behaving. I figured this might be caused by the default debug settings, but I also testing app.src.main referencing app.src.debug, and that works correctly despite using the same default settings. "

The variable appears to be a global scope, and I see and but no examples of how to use them, or how they link to parent scopes.

"Kotlin object (singleton) with an Android Application Context"," I've been looking into Android development using Kotlin and I ran into a situation. I'm trying to figure out how to create a singleton using the recommended Kotlin \"object\" and pass it an Android Context, more specifically the context from the Context.getApplicationContext() method. It's essentially the same question as here, but since Kotlin was in beta until just a few days ago, I was wondering if the answer might have changed for V1.0.0. I'd rather not use the accepted answer in the referred question (use a setter to set the context) because it would mean I'd have to (re)set the context to make sure it's not null before using the singleton. Not a big deal, but it feels like there should be a better way. It might also raise issues when setting the context from different threads at the same time...? Or maybe not, since the Context would always be the same Application Context. Using an injection library as suggested in the other answer to that question would work, but I'm looking for a more \"idiomatic\" way of doing this since I'm trying to learn the language. Anyone know another way? Thanks! "

Here is the code: The user would initiate the sequence of events by calling: My questions about this code are: Currently takes in an array of and returns that same array as an observable after the cached items have been associated with it. This feels wrong to me. I think instead this call should only return the items that have a cached associated with it. However, I need to continue passing the full array of to the next method 2.) Do I need to do additional work to support unsubscribing? 3.) This is similar question 1.

"Unresolved reference: Kotlin needs 2 builds after clean to pick up code when using kapt"," In our Android app we're using DBFlow to access the SQLite database. We're referencing the classes generated by DBFlow via Kotlin. We are already aware of the fact that we have the model classes as well as the database class in Java as code generation won't work when writing these classes in Kotlin. However we still have to build the code twice after every project clean. Executing the first build on a device results in for seemingly random Kotlin classes (even if they don't access code generated by DBFlow or any of the model classes defined by us). The same is reported already at compile time when enabling Proguard which of course fails the build. The second build always succeeds. The funny thing is, that code generation already works at the first run - the classes are there and are also picked up by the IDE. But the compiler somehow can't find them making me think that the code generation happens too late in the build process. On the other hand as explained above there are also classes not found which don't have to do anything with code generation and/or annotation processing. So is there a better solution to this problem than a second build? For reference, the relevant parts of our app's looks like this - just like the DBFlow documentation is suggesting: Edit: I found that I also have to rebuild twice for every change I make to the code.

"How to return result in doInBackground after login API completion block is finished in UserLoginTask"," I used default LoginActivity in Android Studio and created a simple login view. In my app, the authentication task and access token generation is done by the server via API call. However, since the api call must have a completion block, my login function in also does. Therefore the authentication result exists in the thread of the completion block, which makes the returned result of the original to incorrect. The functions are overriden, so I cannot change their parameters and formats. I'm still new in android developing and still not very familiar with its asynchronized task, so I would like to ask if there is any way to halt in and wait for the result in the completion block? Or is there any better solution to solve my API login? Thanks. Here the code of my UserLoginTask (written in kotlin but I think the concept would be the same with java): "

Just when trying to assembleRelease the project I am getting proguard errors I do not understand: when I add a dontwarn for these classes in the proguard configuration than it crashes at runtime - so these classes are really removed - but they should not be removed as they are used. I can work around this problem by adding keep class/enum for these classes in the proguard-config - but the question is why this is needed for these classes - IMHO it should not be needed Anyone has some Idea what could cause this or how best to investigate this problem?

"Android local VPN Service: can't get response"," I'm quite new to Android and its services. I'm trying to implement a local VPN service in my app (with Kotlin and Java). QUESTION My VPN service taken from ToyVpn Google example, combined with examples from 1, 2, 3 to use it locally (without connection to remote server) is NOT working. MY APP PRINCIPE I saw this and this SO questions, but the answers there aren't very insightful and I can't find the solution for my issue. So the app is pretty simple: it should forward all of the packets when user click \"YES\"-button on the main activity, and when click \"NO\" - block it. The purpose: to use it as a firewall, like that: All of my code is written on Kotlin language, but it's not complicated and is very clear for JAVA developers. So I hope the code above is pretty clear as it is taken from here (ToyVpn example provided by Google) and just converted to kotlin. MY CONFIGURATION & CODE To enable VPN service in my app I placed in my AndroidManifest.xml into tag this setting: My MainActivity code contains: My VpnFilter class is quite similar to ToyVpn service class, but has to work locally without any authentication, handshake etc, so I've edited example with such settings: And in my run function I've just configured tunnel to connect to the local IP address: Thereby: the settings of the VPN configurations are quite similar to this example and both examples from SO questions, mentioned above, for local usage. and my packet forwarding is taken from ToyVpn example. I know that my VPN is running, because if I change addRoute configuration, I won't be able to access Internet. So I don't know what I'm actually doing wrong! If I use code for packet forwarding from ToyVpn, app is crashing every time new packet comes. Update The above is solved, but I see, that packets are sending away, but I cannot get any response. I can't figure out why. FULL JAVA CODE OF MY VPN SERVICE LOG CAT OUTPUT In my LogCat panel I've got this trace when app crashes: "

The code is clear and should work properly, but it does not! Basicly I want my service to fitler packets by IP address.

My second question: Is there a way to make packet filtering simplier if I want to fetch only the IP address?

"Many small modules, or few large modules for best build performance?"," A few years ago, when first adopting gradle for Android (before Gradle 2.0), I found that there was some overhead to using and depending upon a module, so I've stayed away from splitting my project into smaller modules, and instead have created very large modules. After trying out some other build systems (like Buck for instance), performance is gained by splitting your code into multiple small modules. Some of the modern programming languages like Kotlin even have visibility modifiers specifically built around the concept of splitting your code into modules. We're currently at Gradle 2.14.1 (almost 3.0), and for the past several releases, they've quoted massive performance gains. With the changes to Gradle / the Android plugin the past few years, does it now produce faster builds to split your code into smaller modules, or to use fewer large modules? "

"Lifecycle methods in statically typed languages"," In the last year I've become a mobile developer and a functional programming admirer. In each of the mobile arenas there are components with lifecycle methods that make up the meat of the app. The following will use Android and Kotlin as examples, but the same applies to iOS and Swift. In Android, there are 's with lifecycle methods like . You might also define a function, , which will do exactly what the name describes. For the purposes of the question, let's say there's a variable defined in that is used in a button click handler (This is usually the case - is essentially 's setup method). The example class would look like this: Notice the declaration of as a (nullable string) and the use of (null safe call). These are required because the compiler cant guarantee that will be called before . As developers though, we know that will always be called first* **. My question is how can I tell the compiler about the guaranteed order of these methods and eliminate the null checking behavior? * I suppose it's possible to up our and call directly, thus sidestepping the Android framework and lifecycle methods, but the compiler/JVM would likely run into an error before anything interesting happened. ** The guarantee that is called first is provided by the Android framework, which is an external source of truth and might break/function differently in the future. Seeing that all Android apps are based on this source of truth though, I believe it's safe to trust. "

My getRecipes method: How is that possible? I thought that when I use Schedulers.immediate(), the operation will be performed on the same thread and my TestSubscriber receives the events. If not, how should I write this test so it succeeds? I want to test that onNext is called and I don't want to insert artificial sleep commands between. "
"Android Kotlin Moshi Custom Json Adapter"," Ok so i have the following Json Pojo: And i want to write a customs deserialiser, so the final object will look like this: Basically, the mappings are: based on some value inside JProduct The JCategory two lists will be joint into 1, in which will contain more JCategory plus Prod1/Prod2. Is this a valid and efficient way of mapping the data in this adapter according to Moshi? Notice that i have a JCategory and inside a list of the same object, so i thought the Adapter would parse this automatically but it doesn't. So i tried and it worked. So my questions are: is the proper way of handling cases like this? how can i map an object to another one/other based on some property inside it? The fromJson can only return 1 type of transformed object. "

"Kotlin - possibly incorrectly reporting an unused code"," I have a base class for all activities in my app. I want a variable to be of type .

The following code: gives me an error \"Type inference failed. Expected type mismatch: required , found \". This causes problems mainly when I am committing code changes because the options \"Cleanup\" and \"Optimize imports\" in AS commit wizard are checked, which removes \"unused\" code (the \"as Class\" part), which is in fact actually used. The solution is not to turn these options off because I actually want them to be set to true. If I commit my changes, go to the class where the casting is used and undo the changes, it asks me \"Undo Optimize Imports before commit?\". If I confirm, I get the casting back, so I know this is causing the issue. PS: I use Kotlin 1.0.5-3 "

Thank you. P.S. I know that I can cast it to E, but in my opinion, it should not be needed in this situation. Maybe I am missing something obvious here or probably lack of Kotlin knowledge. UPDATE1: After the first answer, we have realized that code above does not make much sense since we have to define a type of returning provider and to pass it into create method. Initial idea was that create method returns some type which is BaseProvider subtype. Here are the changes I have made in order to support the initial idea: IDataProvider BaseProvider ChildProvider UI call Although, createModel method returns RealmObject, it's instance will be of ChildRealmModel. What I don't like about it is that we have to inspect instance type and cast into if we need exact model somewhere else. "

"Converting Android project with databinding from Java to Kotlin"," I have a large Android project written in Java and am currently converting it to Kotlin. Many of my activites and fragments use databinding. Initially, when I converted my first activity using databinding to Kotlin, the project was unable to build for this activity. The error said there were missing references to the databinding library. I added: to dependencies in and also to the same file. After building, the Kotlin activity with databinding worked, whereas all the remaining Java databinding activites now report that the databinding package reference does not exist. This leaves me in a tough spot. I was planning on converting the activities and fragments one by one to Kotlin and building them as I go, but this seems not doable at the moment since I have to make a choice between Java or Kotlin working at every build. I found Kotterknife:  , which is a view injection library for Kotlin, but I still cannot believe that there is no way to slowly convert your activities from Java to Kotlin, even if they do use databinding. It simply does not seem credible to me. Has anyone done converted a project in such a way in the past and succeeded without having to make a choice one or the other? Is there a way to convert single activities as you go along? The other option is to just convert all the Java to Kotlin in one go and then make one single build after it's all done, but that seems a bit risky if you put in all the work and then realize you overlooked something. Any ideas? Thanks in advance. "

"Realm returning stale data"," I don't have a lot of experience writing Android apps. For fun I am writing an app that will upload my call logs to my server. This entire app is running as a Service. The Service (starts when the phone is booted) is the one that registers the ContentObserver, which then calls my custom class. I use to listen for content change events. Unfortunately, the ContentObserver is called multiple times when I e.g. dial a number. For that reason, I have function that I call after a successful upload (I use Retrofit) called . This function creates a called (which is different from my regular model). This simply has one identifier which is the of the call, which should be unique enough. Then, when I am iterating through the list of all the call logs, I check every single call log against a function, which does a Realm query and checks to see if there is already a call log with that dateTime stored in the database (realm). In theory, it should work. However, I have noticed that it does not always work. It seems that very often my data is stale. When I do , it returns false (although I swear it returned true once). In my function, even when I do a on the Realm, I do not see all of my data - but the data definitely did hit the function.

"firebase db: models with Kotlin delegated properties"," I'm using Kotlin objects to work with my Firebase Database models, as described in the guide. I have many fields that are stored as strings, but really are enums, so to be type-safe I have enum fields in the models, plus a string delegated property that returns the firebase stored value (as suggested in a question I asked some time ago). Now, these fields work if I get/set the string delegate in code, but firebase libs seem to skip them when converting to/from database's json format. A simple example: The always gives a error, but works, if I delete field and make a normal property. It's similar for reading: Firebase gives no errors when getting a Weight object, but the field is never set to anything else than the default. But, if I manually do , the field properly returns . I'm using firebase libs v10.0.1 Now, the questions: What can I do to make the delegated properties work correctly with firebase? I can try a different approach to the delegated enum fields, as long as the points from my original question are satisfied (readable, concise and type-safe code). is there any way to see how exactly do firebase libs convert objects to/from json? Or at least see the converted json? Maybe then I could tweak things myself. Unfortunately, everything firebase-related shows as in AndroidStudio. UPDATE: I could of course add a method to each model, where I would construct a map containing all the properties needed in firebase, but it would be tiresome to do this for every model, and it solves the saving issue only, the enum fields still wouldn't be set when getting. The delegated props are also skipped when serializing with GSON. So maybe is there a generic way to make the delegated properties look like regular fields? "

I would like to ask if there is a better way to avoid all these classes. I don't want to use inner classes.

"IntelliJ and Android Studio icons for Kotlin files"," I have been tinkering trying to understand what IntelliJ (and Android Studio) are doing to my Kotlin file icons. In the picture you can see that Kotlin files come with two different icons - either a rectangle with a small \"K\" or a circled C with a small \"K\" (circled in red in the picture). The rectangle version also includes a useful \".kt\" suffix. After some tinkering with this black box of a problem - it appears that if the kotlin file just declares a class matching the file name then it gets a \"circled C\" icon. But if it does anything that is un-Java-like - such as declaring a variable outside the class (e.g. ) - then the icon is shifted to the rectangle with the \"K\". The icon documentation here suggests that IntelliJ thinks the rectangle with the \"K\" is a \"Kotlin file\" whereas the circled C is a \"Kotlin class\". Does anybody know if there is a deeper meaning to this? I think I will include a declaration outside the class just to get my Kotlin file icon symbols all to match. Then they will also have the handy \".kt\" extension to clearly indicate that they are Kotlin files. For example - here is code that will change your icon to a rectangle with a \"K\" in file Foo.kt: "

To check why, I logged all the relevant stuff about the properties of one class -- turns out their field reads (and all other attributes remain the same as on a debug build). I already have a line in proguard config to keep all the models: I tried this one before, with same result: Why/how does proguard affect property visibility? Should I modify the config somehow? Or am I missing something else here? UPDATE: It seems like visibility is not the only thing. also doesn't work, it returns for properties declared nullable.

"Share a Kotlin module with an Android and Desktop project"," I have a game that I am working on that uses the LibGDX game framework. Currently the platforms I am targeting are Desktop (PC, Mac, Linux) via a platform independent jar and Android. The project is hosted at  Feel free to take a look if you need to. The bulk of the code is in a module called and is written entirely in Kotlin. This module is linked into both the Desktop and Android projects. This works fine for Android versions 7.1+ and for desktop. For all other versions of Android I get a pile of exceptions on anonymous functions such as this: Exception Sample: It seems to be caused by an incompatibility with the JVM that Kotlin targets by default (1.8) and the JVM level that older versions of Android support (1.6). I could be wrong but this explains why the latest version of Android works as it supports a later version of the JVM. The solution should be as simple as forcing Kotlin to emit JVM byte code as version 1.6 but I can't seem to work it out. If you compile Kotlin directly into an Android, this seems to be handled by using the Gradle plugin. Unfortunately I can't use this plugin for the core module because it should not have any Android dependencies. I tried to override the JVM version using the build settings mentioned at  like this: However, it did not seem to work no matter which Gradle file I placed it in. In fact I get a \"Cannot resolve symbol 'kotlinOptions'\" error shown by Intellij when I try it. It is possible that the Kotlin team have changed something and the documentation has not been updated. I can override the Kotlin settings manually in the Intellij module settings but it gets overridden every time I sync the gradle project and is not a good long term solution. The project is designed to be IDE independent. Does anyone know how I could set up the core module for max compatibility with older versions of Android? I currently have the minimum API level set to 9 as this is the current LibGDX default but I'm willing to set this higher if it would be too difficult to target such a low API level. Edit 1: I just extracted the jar file produced by the core module and examined the class files using the tool. I ran the following command on a random class file and it output text with the following text using this question List of Java class file format major version numbers? I determined that the class file is actually targeting JVM 1.6. Therefore my original theory is wrong and there is another reason why older Android versions cannot load classes generated by Kotlin lambdas. "

"Implementation of a \"valve\" for Observable streams, including buffering the last element emmitted before the valve reopened"," I'm trying to wrap my head around how to implement something in RxJava (2.0). It's for Android and I'm using Kotlin, although the choice of platform and language shouldn't matter here. The idea is that I'd base some sort of MVP architecture on RxJava. In this implementation I'm thinking about an (could be a or a custom as well) exposes a stream of values (s for simplicity) which indicate lifecycle events, or whether the view is attached or detached. The underlying idea is basically this: And then from the other end, the Presenter exposes an that is a stream of objects representing screen states - to be rendered by the View. (This follows the concept explained in this series  - which boils down to the fact that the Presenter feeds the View with standalone objects encapsulating screen states in their entirety rather than multiple different methods on the View). And then I'd like to bind these two observable streams so that: Whenever the View gets detached, input from the Presenter is disregarded (and it's not buffered, so as not to run into any backpressure problems) However, once the View gets reattached, it picks up the latest state the Presenter emmitted. In other words, only one state instance is to be buffered at most. It would work as follows (assuming the states are of type for simplicity): I'm not sure what the best, idiomatic solution is. I tried to implement it as an , but I couldn't quite get it right. I believe the transformer should be stateless, whereas my solution gravitated towards explicitly keeping track of what was emmitted and buffering the last element \"manually\" etc., which feels messy and too imperative, so I suppose it's wrong. I found  but the implementation looks very complex and I can't believe it couldn't be done in a simpler manner (I don't need all the flexibility, I only want something that works for the described usecase). Any insights would be appreciated, including whether there's something else I should take into consideration still, within the context of Android. Also note that I don't use RxKotlin bindings (I may, I just didn't suppose they should be required here). EDIT: Below is my current implementation. As I said, I'm not too happy about it because it's explicitly stateful, and I believe this should be achieved declaratively, leveraging some constructs of RxJava. I needed to merge two streams of different types, and because nor didn't quite do it, I resorted to a trick, creating a common wrapper for both distinct type of events. It introduces certain overhead again. "

"What is the editor magic behind Kotlin Android Extensions for Views?"," When I add an import of the form to a Kotlin source it alters the behavior of the Android Studio editor. Specifically, it now considers any property of type to have a property corresponding to each view in the layout file that is assigned an id. I am assuming that I am doing this in a class that is not an or . For example, say I have a declared in the source file and I add a property to it called of type . Further, say that I have a layout named that has three view declarations that have been assigned the ids, , , and . When I add a synthetic import of the form above with a layout-name of suddenly has three new properties, , , and . Or, more correctly, the editor makes it appear as though has these properties. After some research, I have concluded the following: The addition of layout view ids as properties is done blindly. Any view id implied by a such a synthetic import is added to any property of the class that is of type (or a subclass of ). This includes properties of such type inherited by the class. Because the properties are added blindly it is incumbent upon the developer to ensure that the runtime view corresponding to the synthetic import is assigned before the synthetic properties are accessed or an exception will be thrown. If two or more such imports are specified in a file then the union of their view ids will be blindly added to all class properties of type . The purpose of allowing multiple imports is to account for the case where one layout file includes another. Are these conclusions correct? Are any other interesting subtleties around the implementation of this feature? I am using version 1.1.2-5 of the kotlin-gradle-plugin. "

"Why is the first computation in my Android app slow while all subsequent computations are fast"," I'm using the symja android library to perform mathematical calculations for a quiz app I'm building. All of my calculations are performed by passing in a string such as \"1+3 + (4/2)\" to a class within the library called ExprEvaluator(). A sample usage would be When I run my quiz app and answer a question for the first time, the main UI Thread would freeze as it performed the calculation, but all subsequent calculations would be incredibly fast. Below, I have outlined a bunch of strategies I tried in order to solve the problem. Note: I have injected the ExprEvaluator class with Dagger, and it exists as a singleton Strategy 1: Offload the computation to a seperate thread Result: Didn't make a difference in initial computation time and actually resulted in more issues because I needed the result on the main UI Thread. All subsequent computations were fast as usual. Strategy 2: Run a simple initial computation on my SplashScreen Activity. Result: This is the best possible solution I have found yet but the only drawback is that my splash screen takes too long. Once inside the main app, the quiz performs very well. Strategy 3: Run on a new Thread inside the Splash screen activity Result: This solved the problem of the splash screen taking way too long to load but if I answer a question on the main thread and check it's correctness before other thread's initial computation is complete, the UI thread freezes. I noticed that the first call to evaluate would always be slow, no matter the string I pass in. I could pass in \"1\" and the evaluation would take around 4 seconds while all subsequent more complex evaluations take miliseconds at most. Even if I use a new instance of the ExprEvaluator class for every sincle computation like so: I still get a slow initial computation and all subsquent calls to evaluate are lightning fast. I'm not really sure what's happening here, and I'm wondering if it's a native android issue where heavy computation needs to performed at least once for all subsequent calculations to be smooth. "

"Change Navigation drawer item color filter also change the imageView which is use same image id"," In the app have Navigation drawer contains a lot of menu items. The limitation is, there is one item will show its color instance of tint color but the other show tint. With this limitation, I decided to use the color filter to handle the icon color stage of the item drawer. This path work perfectly fine. And my menu looks like this. Every menu expect the main menu should show color state like this selected: blue not selected: gray Main menu selected: show its color not selected: gray And the code to handle the state look like this The problem is If I use imageView and set drawable as same as one of the menu item. The color state will change following the menu item. I don't want to change the tint color of the imageView. But it changes according to the menu item. Then I add tint color in imageView to change to different thin color but it still shows the same color of the menu. For example. In this case, imageView should show only black color. But it show gray or blue according to the menu. The expecting result is the imageView should tint color from the color I set in the XML But the result is it shown the same tint color like the menu item.

"What is the right approach to \"This AsyncTask class should be static or leaks might occur\" in Kotlin Android?"," There are many questions here dealing with in java android. This Handler class should be static or leaks might occur: IncomingHandler This Handler class should be static or leaks might occur:AsyncQueryHandler This AsyncTask class should be static or leaks might occur (anonymous android.os.AsyncTask) The warning is due to the fact that inner class holds an implicit reference to the outer class, and hence preventing the outer class from GC'd. The solution lies in the warning itself that the class should be declared static. However, the solution is java specific. Given that kotlin has no modifier, the closest thing is companion object and companion object does hold reference to it's \"outer class\". Below are my [failed] attempts with remarks Are the assertion about attempt2 and attempt3 correct that even without the linter warning, the code is still leaking?

How can I obfuscate my library and keep my kotlin extensions? edit: It appears that using on the entire package, and even specifying is not enough. The methods simply cannot be referenced in the consumer app. edit2: I believe I have narrowed this down to the file under /META-INF/ being removed when .

"Android Studio 3.0 Databinding reference code not genereted by android studio"," I'm having problem with Android Studio 3.0 and combination of kotlin and data binding. I'm not sure why, but option Settings -> Editor -> Data Binding -> Reference code generated by android studio is not working as it should be. I've tried it on different AS 3.0 versions (Canary 3, Canary 5, Canary 6) with different kotlin (1.1.2-3, 1.1.3, 1.1.3-2) and databinding compiler ver. To be sure I have even created clean project and the same problem occurs. I'm sure that the problem lies in kotlin and databinding combination because in the same project databinding in java class is working just fine, files generated by databinding are updated with every change in .xml file. I'm not going to paste my every gradle content file here because I have tried a lot of combination versions of kotlin and data binding. Below is one of them. I've noticed that while i'm in java file after click (ctrl + click) on file generated by Data binding ex.:activity_main.xml -> ActivityMainBinding.java my screen is being moved directly to activity_main.xml file. After the same action in Kotlin class screen is being moved to ActivityMainBinding.java file. It's very annoying problem becasue with every change in .xml file I'm forced to rebuild project in order to use data binding. Any kind of help or information will be appreciated EDIT: Invalidate caches / restart helps only to first project build. If I create new .xml layout it's working fine until project build. "

However, this method is significantly slower than the webview's native method (~5s vs ~8s). This may partly be because Glide has to confirm with the ui thread with each request to make sure that the view is valid before proceeding with the load. Is there anything that I can do to improve the loading process? (I'd also like to verify that starts loading the resources immediately rather than waiting for to be called on the future target, but I haven't found a way to add a listener yet and don't see it in the docs) "

"Detect Back Button Press in Android View"," I am writing a game app that uses a ChessClock class. Each of the two players has a clock. The clocks send themselves a stream of messages every tenth of a second, and if running, decrement the time remaining. When the time expires the clock calls a method in the parent view group that stops the clocks and sets a flag that causes further touch events to be ignored so that the users can no longer move the pieces. I am writing in kotlin, but I think this will be clear to a java programmer also: This works fine, but if the user presses the back button and then starts a new game, the clocks apparently keep running, even though the activity's onDestroy method has been called. Then when the running clock expires, the new game is frozen even though the new clocks are still running. I'm new to android and I don't understand how this comes about. I would have thought that the clocks would be destroyed when the activity was. I've tested my ideas about what is happening with log messages, and have confirmed that the clocks run after onDestroy are called. I've also overridden onDetachedFromWindow to stop the clocks, and it makes the problem go away, but this is overkill. It will also stop the clock if the user gets a phone call, won't it, and this is not what I want. Can you suggest how to best accomplish what I want? There is no way to access the clocks from the activity is there? I've thought of emitting some event in onDestroy, and having the ChessClock listen for it, but I don't know how to write custom events and listeners yet. Is there an easier way? "

To try and narrow down the problem I tried a couple of sample Anko projects, including android-anko-sample, and they all exhibit this same broken behavior. I have other Android projects I've written in Java, and they run without this problem, which suggests that this is somehow a Kotlin or Anko specific issue. I can even switch back and forth between one of my Java apps and the \"android-anko-sample\" app linked above, and reproduce the problem with android-anko-sample consistently, while my Java app works correctly every time. I have looked at other questions involving this error message, and the solutions posted were either not applicable or didn't help. One thing I have noticed that's weird is that when I open (of any of these Anko apps) in Android Studio the names of the activities are shown in red, as if they are errors. Here's how the one from android-anko-sample looks: Note that the app does get installed on the phone/emulator, and I can tap on the icon and run it.

My big question is whether I have to do this every time I want to develop on Android? I'm assuming the answers a big fat NO, but as someone completely new to this, I definitely need some help from the community if possible. Just to explain me, we have limited development resources, hence the question on here. I'm going to be taking over the Android side of things and should probably sign up for a one-week taster course (or something like that) but for now, I have our whole Android app on our hands with minimal comments, tests or instructions. I also posted this question to Reddit and the best advice I was given was to add a '+' to the dependencies in build.gradle instead of version numbers. I've since tried this and feel like it might not be the solution I need. This is because I feel that the live application wouldn't be working if this were the issue. In short, I feel like my local version of the application might not be working because I have some settings in Kotlin/Android studio somewhere that I need to change.....Any suggestions you can provide RE what these settings may be would be a huge help!

"Android onCheckedChangeListener bizzare behavior"," So I am attempting to code some CheckBox logic for a page in which a user can +1 or -1 a specific entry. The first time my RecyclerViewAdapter is bound, I iterate through the list of votes and check if the user id is present, and if the vote value is +1 or -1 here Which works fine! If I previously voted +1 and reload, boom, the box is checked. The issue, however, comes when I then try to interact with the boxes again. If I hit the +1 box, the check remains and doesnt do anything. This also occurs for the -1 box. I also set my listeners for the CheckBoxes in the bindtask function like so It should also be worth mentioning that I have a socket listener in my fragment class that uses the adapter listening for a +1 and -1 event, in which case it updates the score of the item and notifys the adapter that the data set has changed, like here Can any of you see why my CheckBoxes work fine when nothing is previously selected, but on a page reload it takes multiple clicks just to uncheck the boxes. Does it have to do with notifying the data set has changed in my listener. Am I binding the listeners multiple times so it's messing with my logic? Is my checkbox logic simply wrong? Any help here would be much appreciated. "

"What's the recommended way to deal with Singletons cleanup in Android (Kotlin)?"," I have been having some weird issues in my Android app when closing it via back key and reentering, and found they are happening because variables in 2 Singleton classes I have are never re-initializing (The issue doesn't happen if manually killing the app from task manager). Even after I call finish explicitly on Main activity onBackPressed and I can see onDestroy is called, the Singletons are still in memory. I decided to do manual cleanup of these Singletons before destroying my Activity, the problem is using Kotlin I would need to make all their member variables nullable (?) and it would be a lot of hassle to remember to assign null to every variable, so for now I opted to handle the instantiation of the Singleton like this and just make null the whole instance while cleaning: Client use: These seems more involved than it should, and I know this is not even thread safe, but keep in mind that simply using the 'object' keyword instead of 'class' will not work, as it will prevent any initialization taking place the second time I run the app (the constructor is not being called again and I can't force destroy the instance). This makes me think it might be worth looking into Android dependency injection but I feel like at least one of my Singletons really needs to be accessed on a lot of places so it might not be an elegant solution either (Probably need to refactor it into smaller functionalities). The main issue here is the way android handles destruction but I guess I can't change that, I don't see any reason why it keeps all the static values of non activity classes if the application activities are already destroyed. The question is how do you deal with this cases regardless of the language used? or what do you think are the best practices in this case? Edit: Actually I just did a test with Dagger 2, and the same problem happens, if I use @Provides and @Singleton, the values of member variables on the provided object the second time launching the app are not null so I guess this needs to be dealt with explicitly unless I am missing some more annotations to tell Dagger that the instance should be released at the end of the app life-cycle.

The only option I can think of so far is to: change the classes from data classes (since data classes cannot be extended). then extend these classes only in the android application and add the annotations. Edit: Another way to ask this is, what can be done if there is a (possibly non-open) POJO in another library that wants to be added in Room? "

"Using EventBus to finish an Activity from Base Activity?"," Working on an existing project, I found this rather uncommon piece of implementation (to me at least). Since I am not in contact with the previous developer who already left, and before I dismiss this as a case of simply copy and pasting code from another part of our codebase, I would like to ask the SO community about this. Here's your everyday activity that extends BaseActivity, and the implementation: In BaseActivity.kt, there's a subscription to the event which calls finish(). Now, why would anyone use EventBus to call from the extended BaseActivity, instead of just calling it then and there (in the above SignActivity)? Even if SomeActivity were actually a fragment, you could simply call . *With regards to the intent flags, you could also use to finish all activities in the back stack if your min SDK is 16. Thanks in advance for feeding my curiosity. :D "

"Implementing search that pushes results to list as soon as they become available using rxJava"," I need to implement a search on a large data set that can take some time to complete on mobile devices.

This call is an . As soon as the data from that Observable becomes available I want to loop over it, apply a search predicate and notify any Observers for any match found. So far my idea was to use a to subscribe to and call its function every time the search finds a new match. However I can't seem to get the desired behavior to work. I'm using MVVM + Android Databinding and want to display every matched entry in a so for every event that is received by the observing viewModel I have to call on the RecyclerView's adapter. - The problem I have with the above code is that with an empty query is called 3 times in a row and when the query is not empty isn't called at all.

"Extremely slow in autocompletion & code analysis for Kotlin projects in Intellij IDEA"," We have a project on IDEA that consists of a couple med sized Java packages and one very small Kotlin package (5 files). I noticed performance is fine with any Java packages, but it's 10x slower in autocompletion, code analysis and compilation for the very small Kotlin package. Autocompletion occasionally was so slow to a point where the popover couldn't load all the methods and it had to load a couple API incrementally. Every time our developer types a word and wait for autocomplete, it takes about 2-5 seconds for the expected autocomplete to show up. Sometimes autocomplete was too slow to show anything, and we had to cancel the word and retyped it and waited. Same slowness occurs in code analysis. This is significantly impacting my team's productivity. From our research, it appears this is a well-known long lasting issue. This also happens for our another small project. I was wondering what we can do to fix this? Thanks. Kotlin plugin is latest, Version: 1.1.3-release-IJ2017.2-2 Intellij is also on latest version, 2017 2.1 (built on July 31 2017) "

Second solution would be to use span but it affects on each paragraph for each n lines inside the text (like in this answer -> How to layout text to flow around an image), so I get smth like this: But I wanted to set margin only for first n lines! Then I decided to implement and create a counter and increment it in function invocation. When the counter reach the desirable value, the function returns 0 as a margin width. And there is a fail again! Instead of filling the lines, the text just moved left and didn't spread to the end of the view! UPD: Yes, I've used in here Well, googling for another solution I found this answer  Ok, I've done everything as described and implemented the code: My looks like this: ` ` Well, it works. But how terrible it works! As I'm using view holder pattern I have to hold a variable to the listener and remove if it is not been called and successfully removed because function wasn't called in time!

I have read several articles and spend already couple of days studying Dagger2. This article I use as tutorial to build my example:  In my idea, Dagger architecture should consist of three s : (1) AppComponent, (2) MenuActivityComponent and (3) AccountFragmentComponent. And from my understanding and the picture of an architecture in the article my architecture can be like this: (3) depends on -> (2) depends on -> (1) Each has a : (1) AppModule, (2) MenuActivityModule and (3) AccountFragmentModule respectively. For the cleaner way of MVP dependencies, as far as I understand, both (2) MenuActivityModule and (3) AccountFragmentModule should s from MVP ideology to be in and other s, such as . AppModule AppComponent MenuActivityModule MenuActivityComponent AccountsFragmentModule AccountsFragmentComponent Also I have two s: ActivityScope and FragmentScope, so as I understand that will guarantee the existence of only one Component for the time every component is need in the application. ActivityScope FragmentScope In Application class I create a graph of dependencies. In MenuActivity: MainActivityPresenter activity_menu.xml And the place where I have a breaking point in my understanding: My misunderstanding in this final part in the value.

Of course, I could say , but I want to run code based on if it is true. Is there a magic operator Kotlin has that I don't know about? Should I make a function to handle this situation for me, although the syntax of calling that would be different than an if statement?

"Clean Architecture: Use different model classes for different data sources?"," I am currently developing a news feed android app. I try to design my app according to the principles of clean architecture. In the data layer I am using the repository pattern as a facade for the diferent data sources: remote data from an API ( , local data from an DB (Realm or SQLite) as well as some in-memory cache. In my domain layer I have defined some immutable model classes (Article, NewsSource, etc.) which are being used by the domain layer as well as the presentation layer (no need for extra model classes in the presentation layer in my opinion). Does it make sense to use different model classes for the remote data source as well as for the local data source? E.g. The remote data source uses Retrofit to make API calls and the models need to be annotated in order to be parsed by GSON. The models for the local data source also may have to fulfill some certain contract like models in a Realm DB need to extend RealmObject. Obviously, I don´t want my domain models to be 'polluted' by any data source specific contract (annotations, RealmObject inheritance, etc.). So I thought it would make sense to use different models for different data sources and the repository handles the mapping between them. E.g. We want to fetch all articles from the remote API, store them in the local DB and return them to the domain layer. Flow would be like: Remote data source makes http request to news api and retrieves a list of ´s. The repository would map these models to a Domain specific article model (). Then these would be mapped to DB models (e.g. ) and inserted into the DB. Finally the list of ´s would be returned to the caller. Two questions arise: The above example shows how many allocations there would be using this approach. For every article that is going to be downloaded and inserted into the DB, three models would be created in that process. Would that be overkill? Also, I know that the data layer should use different model classes than the domain layer (inner layer should no nothing about outer layer). But how would that make sense in the above example. I would already have two different model classes for the two different data sources. Adding a third one that´s being used as a 'mediator' model by the data-layer/repository to handle mapping to other models (remote, local, domain) would add even more allocations. So should the data layer know nothing about domain models and let the domain do the mapping from a data layer model to a domain layer model? Should there be a generic model used only by the repository/data-layer? Thank, I really appreciate any help from more experienced developers :) "
"Android WebView jumps to the top on each page update(?)"," I am implementing standard Web View activity with javascript and I came across some unwanted behaviour that makes it impossible to interact with (one, for now) webpage. standard stuff, but when I navigated from to , the webview doesn't properly handle this request - every time I scrolled or clicked some reference it jumps right to the top, and the page becomes unresponsive. I looked at the logs in desktop browser and it seems to be co-related with adverts updates in that webpage. But I can be wrong.

"Kotlin and idiomatic way to write, 'if not null, else...' based around mutable value"," Suppose we have this code: Unlike in Java, where you could be left alone to worry about null dereferencing at runtime, this doesn't compile - quite rightly. Of course, may no longer be null once within the 'if'. My question is what's the best way to handle this? A few options are apparent. Without using any new Kotlin language features, the simplest way is obviously to copy the value to a method-scope one that won't subsequently change. There's this: This has the obvious disadvantage that you need to return early or otherwise avoid executing the subsequent code - OK in certain, small contexts, but has a smell to it. Then there's this possibility: but whilst it has greater clarity of purpose, arguably it's more unwieldy and verbose than the Java-style way of dealing with this. Am I missing anything, and is there a preferred idiom with which to achieve this? "

I must have run it on this device 100 times, and even after this occurred it runs perfectly fine on other test devices, plus the iOS app that gets the exact same json at start up What I am looking for Advice on how to deal with the issue, or information whether it's a known bug in Android or Kotlin. I can probably reinstall the app on the device and it will be ok again but would not want this happening once the app was released, if I can prevent it. LaterEdit: With Xaviers suggestion, I have copied the file onto the desktop and it's definitely malformed, when it loads it actually shows some seriously malformed image of things running on the Mac. I have tried to upload it but it just displays as an empty white image. It still has 8kb, so it contains some data. How is this possible and can it be prevented?

"Kotlin + Dagger - inject Map for ViewModel factory"," I'm using the new Architecture Components with Dagger2 and I would like to inject my ViewModels using a Factory class. The Factory class is itself injectable. This all works well when the Factory class is defined in Java, but when I convert it to Kotlin, Dagger2 does not know how to generate the Map for the constructor, while in Java it knows how to do so. I presume the difference is that, after conversion, the Factory class uses the Map from the kotlin package, as opposed to from java.util.Map package. How can I get Dagger2 to generate the map for the Factory constructor? Here's the Factory class and this is the error I tried creating a module to provide the map, but that didn't help. "

"Deserialize a field that can be one of two data types using Moshi"," I'm receiving some JSON from an OrientDB server that looks something like this: Now these two fields and can be one of two types: and my own custom object (let's call it a ). For example, for one request I might receive this: For another I might get: And so on. Both might be s, both might be , one might be a and the other a , et cetera et cetera. Now when I'm deserializing this kind of JSON using Moshi, I'd have two parameters and to hold the values of their respective keys; however, because these values aren't a fixed data type, that's easier said than done. Creating multiple POJOs (or \"POKO\"s, I guess, because I'm using Kotlin) wouldn't work, because these objects can be found inside other JSON objects and stuff like that. I'd need a single object for which these parameters can take on a variable data type. So how would I do that? Would I have to write a custom adapter in Moshi for serializing/deserializing these values? If so, how would I go about writing one that can assign a certain data type depending on the value of the parameter? Or is there some sort of Kotlin class/function/extension function I can find/write that can hold two possible data types? If it's relevant, I'm also using Retrofit 2 + RxJava 2 to make my HTTP calls asynchronously, so if there's any data types or functions in these libraries that facilitates something like this, I'm all ears. Even if anyone can only answer in Java that's okay, because I can convert the code myself. And if I'm missing something obvious, I apologize in advance. "

"Can i have two xml layouts use the same viewholder using Kotlin synthetic extensions?"," I have a list view that has expandable rows. When i click on the row, i inflate a different xml layout which is very similar ((left) and (right)) and has almost all the same views, but some sub views appear in different sizes (for example the image view is enlarged) and there is one additional button in the expanded view (Save Photo). Upon converting this file to kotlin and trying to access the views using the kotlin synthetic extensions, i receive the error . This makes sense because there are indeed two xml files which have the same ids and are both imported in this file. Most stackoverflow posts i see (such as this one) are resolved by removing one of the import statements or changing the ids. But i want the ids to match because i want to have one shared ViewHolder that can bind both of these different views. After all, the text views and images are all the same content, just in a different visual layout. I could do this in Java with butterknife because i simply annotate the button that doesn't exist in the collapsed layout () as nullable and do some null checks in the binding.

"Android View get original \"Wrap Content\" Size of my view"," I have a question about Android Views that appears to have been asked several times. But still I never get exactly the answer I need. I have to create a View that changes it's size (height) according to a given percentage. That means, I want something like In order to do so, I need the original height of the view without any changes or the outer layout (so no Match_Parent). There are many ways and possible moments to calculate the views height but they all seem to have the current height as a result - not the \"desired\" one. For instance I tried to use onMeasure() since this is the moment when the view is measured but it is also called when changing the views heigh. It also is done on the view \"creation\" several time. So I can't even take the first value that comes because it sometimes is called twice with the first measurement giving wrong data (e.g. a height of 0 until the second onMeasure gives the real one). I now did something that is also not really great but seems to work. I added a Listener like that and in the callback method I remove the listener This seems to work more or less but is that really the way to do?

"Kotlin & Anko coroutines: return outside async"," In our project we need to obtain some data (which will be stored) before doing operations. In case the data was obtained more than 15 minutes ago we have to refresh it. We're using Kotlin + Anko coroutines in order to do that. The idea (assuming the data was obtained at some point before) is that: The method gets called and checks when we got the data. If it was less than 15 min ago, returns it. If not, obtain it asynchronously (it's a network operation), store it and return it. Since we can't do anything before getting the refreshed data, the refresh must be synchronous (althrough the network operation itself is async). We've this code: How can we make the function wait for the result outside the async(UI) block? That return is needed, but we have no clue about what should we put there. We've tried with the getCompleted() method of the Deferred object ( return asyncUser.getCompleted()) but it ends up crashing because it returns null. Thank you! "

"How can I obfuscate my sdk coded with kotlin (and get rid of Metadata)"," I'm developing a SDK (Android library), and I have to obfuscate a large part of my code so the customer may not try and play with internal code. My lib is coded in kotlin, and I used proguard to obfuscate the code. Problem is that there are still @kotlin.Metadata (runtime) annotations inside the code after compile and obfuscation. With those annotations, it's really easy to retrieve the java code that originated this \"(not-so-)obfuscated\" bytecode. I first thought it was my fault, and my project had too many entropy sources that might have induced this behaviour, so I made a sample project to prove that the problem does not come from my sdk implementation. I created a new project with AS, then a lib module with 2 files : facade.kt is my facade class, the one that I do not wish to obfuscate, so the customer may use it : and in this sample, internal.kt holds the classes that I want to obfuscate : The proguard rules are injected into gradle project with this release closure : And here is (only one line, nothing more) : The result : when I , I do obtain an aar in which my facade is kept, and my internal class has been renamed in 'a', with one method 'a', except that the class is still annotated with kotlin @Metadata, which holds every information that helps the decompiler retrieve the original class name, the method, attribute and argument names, etc... So my code is not so obfuscated at all... So my question : is it possible to get rid of those annotations, am I the only one facing this problem, or have I missed something ? "

"How to use Realm in a library"," i'm trying to understand how to use Realm in a library that i'm making, i now understand RealmModules after a couple of days of research (if someone from Realm reads this, you should really improve on documentation about use in libraries).

My :app gradle is this and my library gradle is this and this is my project gradle and based on if i add or not the apply plugin: 'realm-android' to the :app module i get either RealmObject \"X\" is not part of the schema for this realm or if i add the plugin to the app gradle it fails to build the project completely. Is there anyone that has used Realm in a library and wants to explain how, clearly and in depth, maybe this could be used as future reference EDIT: With the above configuration i get this error when building EDIT 2: I managed to get it working by defining modules for both app and library and avoiding naming the realm models in the app the same as the ones in the library ( is this required? Or is there a way to isolate the library models so that the user can use the same names that the library models use?) Still this took me 2 days of research and i'm still unsure if I'm doing it right.

"ViewModel for Fragment instead accessing Activity ViewModel?"," The problem is quite straightforward. The question is in context of using ViewModels, LiveData and other related Lifecycle aware arch approaches. I have an Activity with NavDrawer, which switches fragments inside. And also I have a case when two fragments are present at the same time on the screen - this will be the main pain. One Fragment has a ViewPager with nested (don't ask why). The other fragment is just obtaining info from first one when user performs some actions. This is achieved just by sharing activity viewmodel. But the app itself has a lot of business logic and as it goes further the viewmodel goes bigger and bigger. What I want to ask - not a receipt or rules how to fix this, or maybe how to overcome this by fixing the entire structure of the project. I want to ask for suggestions how can I apply the MVVM approach within android.arch.lifecycle style to mine use-case. I haven't seen something more complicated then just sharing the Activity ViewModel between Fragments. But common, that's not a cure. What you can see here - a mess actually. The point is that all are sharing the . Connections(aggregation) from FirstFragment mean that inside is initiating and they are also working with the same (kill me). So as result everyone is working with one shared ViewModel. My proposal is to add a ViewModel for each Layer. So that Activity/Fragments/ChildFragments have their own ViewModels. But what appears here - how we should communicate then? Possible solutions : Having two ViewModels per one component. One ViewModel will handle/delegate the business logic and another will make the communication. Two viewmodels per component - not so good, yeah? Having old manner interface(please no!) Other workarounds - like DB/SharedPrefs/Realm change listeners and Event Buses(I'm too old for this :( ). Your solution here! I'll say that all of the above are breaking a lot of design principles, so what should I do? How should I come out of this mess? Is there any or another here to help? P.S. - Well, creating UMLs or other charts isn't mine forte. Sorry for that. P.P.S. - I'm aware of google samples. "

I write in kotlin and my UI is dynamically generated, i create the rows & textViews like this: I have tried: using different values for different screen sizes; hdpi, mdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi - This result was very ugly and did not work at all, the 10\" tablet was recognized as a large device but had poor resolution so the text went way out of the screen, other 10\" tables was ok. so this method is completle useless. right? I hardcoded the textSize to be very small, and made a loop that would increase it by one for every cycle. Problem here is that the textView's are not rendered before the function returns. So the loop condition is never able to check if the new textSize matches 1/17 in height of the outer containers height. When debuggin and stepping over 'tw.textSize = newTextSize' which should also increase the height of the row but since it doesn't render nh = nameRow.height is still the same so the loop just runs in infinity... ` DID NOT WORK (didn't try yet) then there is this \"new\" Autosizing TextView, but I can't find any examples to configure it to be 1/17 of somethings height and autosize to that, and I'm a bit confused if it will work on older devices since it states to require android 8.0 API level 26 ??? - can this do what i'm trying?

"Create file from Byte Array sent inside JSON Object kotlin"," I have a JSON Object that contains an array of bytes. That array of bytes should create a file. I have done this in iOS and it works, however, trying to do the same task in Android, the text in the resulting file is completely different. I have found plenty of questions and solutions for writing the byteArray to file, and after trying about 6 approaches, so far, this is my solution (probably not the best one I tried, but they all outputted the same content for the file: I have compared the byteArray (I know in this formula of my code it's a list of Int's but it's a shorter way of safely casting from a ) between the working iOS version and this one and they match perfectly. However, the output it's completely different and a bunch of gibberish in Android. I keep thinking the encoding must be different, but I have read some answers for similar questions where people were saying that Java doesn't use encoding, so where an I going wrong? EDIT: After comparing more in depth the iOS vs Android process, I notice in iOS it's writing Data to File and that Data is the same as the text coming out in the Android Document. So I tried to convert that data into a DataOutputStream and write the bytes through it (updated code). In my head it made sense when I wrote it but the result is the same. It might help to see the \"text\" so here's the output: Also, this is code for sharing the file to a text editor: Everything is done according to Kotlin Coroutines, so the async aspect is taken care of and not part of the problem.

"My RecyclerView isn't notified appropriately"," I have a RecyclerView activity and a ViewModel class. The activity calls a method in ViewModel which consumes a web-service, and it also observes a LiveData field. Every time the method gets back an an item from the web-service it sets it to the LiveData and so the observer in the Activity is notified and thus all items enter the RecyclerView. It is guaranteed that this flow works correctly as I can see so in the logs, and in the UI too. The problem arises when I put a delay with Thread.slepp(500) in the method where the web-service is consumed. Instead of putting an item in the RecyclerView then wait for 500millis and then put another, it waits 500 millis * numberOfItems and then draws them all together. I can assure that there is no problem with the ViewModel and LiveData setup because the log works as intended meaning, it print the title of the item created, waits 500 millis, prints the next one. So the problem lies only with the adapter and how it's notified only after the method call is complete. My question is how can I notify the adapter every-time the observer is called? here is my implementation of the three classes: RecipeList RecipeViewModel and the RecipeAdapter I am looking forward for your suggestions, Thank you in advance "

"Architecture of own SDK - async method API in Kotlin"," We are building a public SDK for our product. It is built with Kotlin and internally we use coroutines. However, we want to publish an API that is usable form JAVA, that's why can't provide suspendable functions as public API. We are ok, if the usability in Java will be less comfortable than in Kotlin, that's quite expected. So, for example, we are looking of a return type of the following async method: Things we have considered: Using a RX Java as a the interface. We don't like this solutions, Rx is quite complex and we want to add as little as possible of other dependencies. Generally, we would go with returning Single. But, Rx java things we don't want to solve (which thread should be the work done) and Rx don't solve things we would like to solve (if possible), e.g. lifecycle & observer - the things solved in Android architecture components. Java 8 Future. This seems to be most appropriate but not possible since we need to target older Androids (4.1 at least). Android architecture LiveData. Returning a LiveData seems to be ok, there is also a observeForever() method that makes it usable in backgrounds threads. On the other hand, the api suggests that it may return repeatadly multiple results. But we want definitely omit only on result or one exception. In Kotlin, though, we may implement extension functions which will make it quite usable as . Custom solution: return a simple Result object, you may subsrcibe for the result by providing a callback ; we will provide an extension function for awaiting. The questions: Did we miss some important aspect/library/possibility? Which solution we should choose and why. "

"Clean Coroutines usage in Kotlin with Unit Test support"," Since a while we're working with Kotlin and one of the things we're currently focussing on is using Coroutines to take care of operations we want to run async. While the example usages are clear and that works, I'm having some issues integrating this in a clean manner within our architecture. When looking at a method's implementation for a domain-focussed class, the idea is that it's easy to read and there is as less \"noise\" as possible from async functionality. I know I can't have async, without actually using it. So writing something like this is what I'd like: But this is what I'd like to prevent: That, I'd like paired with practical Unit Tests for these domain-focussed classes, but I can't really get that to work. Let's look at an example: That works (screenshot:  Now lets look at the test. Now this test is less than ideal, but regardless, it never even gets to the point where it can verify things work as intended, because lateinit var data wasn't initialized. Now ultimately the aesthetics and readability of our domain classes is simply how far I want to go, which I have some practical working examples for that I'm happy with. But making my tests work seems to be challenging. Now there's some different write-ups online about this kind of stuff, but nothing has really worked out for me. This ( seems interesting, but I don't like the idea of a calling class launching a context for a presenter, because that in turn has a dependency that does some async work. Although as an abstract thought I like the idea of \"Hey presenter, whatever you do, report back to me on a UI context\", it rather feels as a fix to make things work, leading to a shared concern for async functionality across different objects. Anyway, my question: Moving away from the short examples, does anyone have any pointers on how to integrate coroutines within a bigger architecture, with working unit tests? I'm also very open to arguments that make me alter my way of viewing things, given that's it's convincing on a different level than \"If you want things to work, you have to sacrifice.\". This question goes beyond just making the example work, as that is just an isolated example, while I'm looking for a real solid integration within a big project. Looking forward to your input. Thanks in advance. "

At a later stage, or on a SwipeRefreshLayout event, reconnect and subscribe to the service to get fresh content. The issue I am receiving is that within a MediaBrowserService (after a subscription has been created) you can only call sendResult() once from the onLoadChildren() method, so the next time you try to subscribe to the media browser service using the same root, you get the following exception when sendResult() is called for the second time: I call the following methods to connect to and disconnect from the media browser (again, everything runs smoothly on first connection, but on the second connection I'm not sure how to refresh the content via a subscription): I unsubscribe and disconnect in onPause() instead of onDestroy() so that the subscription is recreated even if the activity is kept on the back-stack. Actual method used for swipe refresh, in activity and service respectively: Activity Service Other research: I have referred to the Google Samples code on Github, as well as...   Neither of the above repos seem to handle the issue of refreshing content after the media browser service has been created and the activity has subscribed at least once - I'd like to avoid restarting the service so that the music can continue playing in the background. Possible related issues: MediaBrowser.subscribe doesn't work after I get back to activity 1 from activity 2 (6.0.1 Android) --no effect on current issue "

The only solution I found is convert both classes to data classes and it works perfectly(ofcourse I've to remove the RealmObject extension and make RealmList a normal list), but I need to extend RealmObject() class and data classes cannot be open which is needed by Realm db for the model.

"Streamlined Adding and Replacing Fragments in Kotlin"," I am working on a small App with just a few screens that I want to implement as a single Activity which calls several fragments. I have some experience in Java for Android but using Kotlin is new territory. I have understood how to basically add fragments in Kotlin, but I'd like to do it in a reusable way. I came across the solution mentioned here and it works, but there is something I don't quite understand. My following MainActivity works so far, but I have to create the var welcomeFragment in the onCreate method like I did it here: I don't seem to get why I can't declare the property and later assign it. It's possible to declare it with lateinit but when I then try to assign it like this: I get \"Type mismatch - Required: Fragment, found: WelcomeFragment!\" Also, if I try to do this: Android Studio complains about WelcomeFragment ´(which is right now just empty except for a TextView saying \"Welcome\") not having a companion object. I have tried to make one but I don't really understand what it has to do. Reading the documentation didnt help me either with this one. So my question is: How do I do the instantiating right, and or do I have to do it at all when most of my fragments will be one instance only. Can I avoid this by properly adding a companion object to my fragments? How would that look? Any help on this, hints at misconceptions I have here, or general stupidity pointed out would be greatly appreciated! "

"Is the best way using lateinit?"," There is processing to acquire the image held by android using the cursor.The cursor needs authorization to external storage. If AndroidOS is 6.0 or higher and authorization permission is not obtained, the application will be terminated. If permission is obtained, processing to close the cursor is necessary. If it is Java, it would have been nice to write to onStop as follows, except for Kotlin, an exception will be raised. So I wrote that we initialize the cursor and finish it. This no longer causes an exception, but it seems that you write unnecessary code, and it does not get clearer. However, I do not lateinit the cursor, and I think that it is useless code to initialize it at the time of declaration. Also, when declaring , I think that a null judgment code is necessary in various places and I do not think it is like Kotlin. I would be pleased if you could give me advice on how to write the best.

"How to change width of a FlexBox child element after it is added to the FlexBox"," We have a linear layout with a button and a View (a line that separates the button from other views).

The problem is that I can't make the inner button match the width of the parent linear layout and set the minimum width at the same time. When I set the buttons width (in xml) to match_parent the parent element ends up being only as big as the text in the button (it needs to be about 20% bigger in case the text changes). In this instance setMinnimumWidth() seems to have no affect. But when I set the buttons width (in xml) to WrapContent then the setMinimumWidth() does work. The button shows up as the correct size but the parent element is much bigger than the button (presumably to fill in the remaining space in the flexBox row.

"Static reference to application context and resources in a companion object of Application"," I've read a number of articles and stackoverflow posts regarding this question (mainly context instead of resources).

On the other hand, passing to every Object's function is quite daunting. In Java, one way to overcome this was to do something like but you can't do that with Kotlin objects and I'm not too sure about implementing Kotlin Singletons with Arguments. So, I have the following code: As you can see, I'm keeping a static reference to the application context and resources in a when onCreate is called. With this, I'm able to (as examples): call in a util that make API calls with Ion. call in a util that uses resource strings.

"Fragment content is hidden behind BottomNavigationView when scrolling"," I've researched through this quite heavily and am at a loss on what to do - I have some content in a fragment that is being clipped off by the BottomNavigation bar in the activity and am not sure what to do. I've tried adding to the NestedScrollView but the bottom piece of the content (the names of the locations) is still being cut off - there's probably an easy fix for this but I can't figure it out. The XML for my main activity and the \"home\" fragment is as follows: activity_home.xml home_fragment.xml app_bar.xml As an example to show what I mean, here is the content when the navigation bar is moved out of the way and here is the content with the bar in the way. I'm thinking that the problem is some sort of margin/padding issue, but can't quite figure out what to fix. Edit: I've create a repository with the relevant code (and a workable emulator example) here - please be aware that the code is written in Kotlin, but I don't imagine the issue lies witihn any of the actual code, but more within the layout "

"How to use \"setTextColor(hexaValue)\" on Kotlin for Android,"," Background In Java, I could directly change the text color of a TextView, using the standard hexa-decimal value of it: Very easy... The problem On Kotlin, if I try to write such a thing, I get with a weird build error: What I've tried I tried to search about this over the Internet, and I couldn't see anything special about hexa-decimal values. Seems the same like on Java:  Then I decided to just write in Java, and convert to Kotlin. The result is very unreadable in terms of the color value: To me it seem that the hexadecimal value of Integer that is used for Kotlin is signed, while on Java it's converted to signed one automatically, so this causes flipping of values and the need to set a minus sign when needed. The only thing I can think of, that still allows to read it well, is something like this: However, this has multiple disadvantages: It is way longer. It converts a String, so it's much less efficient Most importantly: it works only from API 26 (Android O) , which currently is active on about 1% of Android devices worldwide. The questions Why does it occur? What exactly can I do to make it the most readable, without string conversions, and work on all Android versions (minSdkVersion 14 in my case) ? "

By setting --stacktrace --debug for compiler option, the message is even more enigmatic: [Edit] It's not a duplicate : the linked question in Emmanuel S comment is a runtime exception. In my case, it's a compile time problem. And, I can correct the bug but the question I ask is about the lack of information about where is excactly the problem. [Edit 2] I give some precision to my question by using an example. Imagine this code: A compile error is fired but I understand why : it's because i've made a type in categoryes. But the error message give no idea where the problem is. After correcting the typo, all is good. So, is there a way to know where the problem is exactly ?

Example in Kotlin: Question: as you can see, I need the last received message in order to prepare the resume call. How can I keep track of it so that when there is a retry it is available to make the resume request? One possible solution may be to create a holder class that just holds a reference to the last message and is updated when a new message is received. This way when there is a retry the last message can be obtained from the holder. Example: I think this might work, but it feels like a hack (thread synchronization issues?). Is there a better way to keep track of the state so it is available for retries? "

Recently, I started using Kotlin for Android development and entered iOS world w/ Swift. My experience with React was kinda cool. I liked the concept of reactivity. And I thought it would be nice to apply this concept to my mobile apps. I know there is a bunch of Rx libraries but rather than just gradle-cocoapods-sync-use it, I wanted to find my own way, well for educational purpose somehow. I couldn't resist it. So, after hours of research, I came up with this idea. Here's the thing: Let's say I'm getting some json array from the server. then I parse and store it in a static class(or object in Kotlin) and I call it AppContext And it has the array of functions, and data itself like this: Then in UI, whenever I want to listen to the value change event, I just write This is pretty much all that I thought. But I think there are some to consider. My question is: What if Garbage Collecter collect the UI object(eg. Fragment) then what will happen if that lambda callback function add to onItemsChanged array from object which gc'd? And what do you think about this idea? and what would you do if you were me? Please don't say \"Just use RxSomething\" Thanks! "

"Youtube styled floating video player"," I'd like to make a floating video player, much like the one in Youtube. The issue I'm coming across is making it persistent and floating above all of my activities. In short, I already have a working view implementation here. The complete code is not important, but it is essentially a view that fills the screen, and consumes touch events accordingly. It works fine when I attach it to a single activity, but that means that the view will stay with that activity only. For this to work across multiple activities, I would need another overlaying activity that stays across all views. The issue with this is that touch events that aren't consumed no longer seem to pass through to the activities below. I'm wondering if there is any implementation that allows such a view to be on a completely separate activity, while allowing some touch events to pass through when specified. I don't want to make a service that requires the permission to draw over other apps, because that is not what I'm doing. All activities are over my content only, and Youtube itself doesn't require this setting. "

"AboutToQuit signal/event in Android"," I'm new to and and I'm coming from a background.

In there is this signal on which is which gets emitted when the application is in an imminent process of being closed. This is very handy when you want, e.g. save settings data to disk just before the application is closed. My question: Is there a similar -like mechanism with which you could get notified when an Android application is imminently closing? EDIT: I would like to make some additions to my question after nPn answer. We cannot rely on the Android Activity Life Cycle as we need this information in a library/SDK we are developing. So we want to get notified when an application that is using our library/SDK is closing. We are developing an for some clients to use in apps. Like this would not be enough, this also uses a native in the background with which is linked with through a interface. The end goal is to get notified in C++ that the application is being destroyed in Android. Having an event/signal in Android would be enough as we could forward the information to C++. So as a resume the layers are: Android App -> Custom Android SDK -> Native C++ SDK If there is something unclear, I will edit the question further "

"How to have implementation of interface repository in other project module in AndroidStudio using Dagger2 and Kotlin"," I want to be able to have 2 different reactive implementation of the interface that is getting user location in other project module in AndroidStudio. So to be specific it can be by using gms, or by just native android LocationManager. Here is my repository interface: So for now, i implement this interface here, in class that is in the same project module in AndroidStudio: So everything is fine, but now i want to have the gms implementation of this in different project module(so i don't need to have gms dependencies in the gradle) and also the native implementation to the other module in Android Studio. The final structure of the project in AndroidStudio will be like location_core, location_gms, location_native. The location_core must not be aware of location_gms and native, i guess in opposite to them - they will have the dependency to location_core. So now, i i have just location_core project module and a LocationClient class, which will provide the context: It is using some Dagger Component, which provide him all the implementation of different objects. So i want to move this LocationClient or make it abstract in location_core project module and move the implementation of it in each location_gms and location_native project module in AndroidStudio. So the LocationClient class in each of them will provide the different implementation of this RxRepository. For now in each location_gms and location_native project module i have just implementation class which implements the repository rxLocationRepository(which i move from the implementation written above) on its own way. The problem is i don't know exactly how to manage all of this with Dagger. Now i am using Dagger like this in my location_core, here is the LocationComponent: and its module: So how to write the actual LocationClient in each of the modules - location_gms and the location_native? How to provide the implementation of the rxLocationRepository which is in each of the location_gms and location_native project modules with Dagger, so that i can just use the interface RxLocationRepository in my location_core module and don't be bother of its implementation, because it will be in each project module? Of course i must point, that those 3 modules never be together i guess, it will be 2 modules in each build_variant i guess. So i have to get rid of the google services dependency in location_core project module build.gradle. UPDATE How i can actually don't have Dagger component in my location_core, in which i am using it in tests like: "

"Android - Using generics to have 1 RxJava retrofit call returning various types using the same interface"," I'm playing around with Generics for the first time to clean up some repeated code I have around retrofit calls. I was able to make a generic retrofit adapter, so my providers didn't have to each have a unique creator, which was really awesome and exciting. Now I'm trying to do a generic network call, but I'm not able to figure it out, and wondering if it's even possible given how Retrofit works? I have 5 services like below right now, all hitting different APIs. Each one has a different end point, but all accept 1 parameter and return their object which is slightly different for each API call. All the response objects implement an interface to normalize the response data so I can display it later Currently, I have a network call for each service like below From my little knowledge of generics, it seems like I should be able to pass in a generic service and handle as many different API ends points using this one RxJava call? I don't know how to access each services getCurrentTradingInfo method though, and from what I do read, I'm doubting if it's possible using retrofit interfaces? I'm not necessarily looking for a complete answer if it's possible (although an explanation would be nice) but I'm wondering if it's even possible to do in this specific scenario? I don't want to keep wasting my time if it's not even possible. "

"Providing mocked object to another mock object constructor?"," First time unit testing, and using Mockito. I'm not sure if I'm thinking about testing this correctly. Here is the situation: In my Android app, I am using Model-View-Presenter. I am trying to test a method in my presenter class called to see if the service manager I pass to it will eventually call a callback (this method is called by the view) by verifying it with mockito. The presenter class also implements a callback interface () that is provided to the 's constructor. What I want in this specific unit test is to verify that is called. The problem: Android unit testing seems to require that ServiceManager be mocked (ServiceManager extends abstract class AsyncTask) because when I call , the Android unit testing lib will throw an exception if it is not mocked. However, if I mock the ServiceManager, I can't provide it with two necessary parameters to the constructor, which SHOULD be mocked, if I'm understanding unit testing correctly. The two parameters to the constructor are an interface callback (which is the presenter class), and a class object that is responsible for sending JSON through http. Both of these should be mocked, correct? Because in a unit test you don't want these dependencies to actually make HTTP calls or call callbacks, right? It seems I'm overthinking this. What I really want is to see if my view object which is passed to presenter, calls , so I should really just forget testing the and just call directly. Is this better than the above route? However, another problem is that even if I call directly to test if the mock view that is passed to presenter is called, that method code contains a call to JSONObject which is Android related code, and since it belongs to the android.jar file, it will throw an exception because it is not mocked! Am I supposed to provide an injection for that too?! I'm lost as how to test this. What's the correct way to verify that the mock view has called ? "

"Optional Observables in combineLatest"," As definied combineLatest in rx emites only if all values have changed at least once. I use it to manipulate views within my android views.

Because Function5 is only called if all Observables have emitted at least 1 item. BUT, the field for status and birthdate are optional and must not be filled. Because all ObservableFields are initialized with null and can not explicitly set to null (not allowed in rxjava 2) status and birthday are not emitted when the user does not type text into it. I considered to use which solves the problem for the string Observables because all string Observables emit at least an empty string. But I can't use this solution for the Date field because it is nullable. Maybe is not the operation I am searching for but I can't find a proper way to handle the optional observables.

As I said above I am trying to replicate this using Dagger, but I cant seem to get the same instance in both the Service and the ViewModel. I think the problem is that I just have two different graphs, but I cant figure out how to join them - even after reading the docs and knowing about Subcomponents.

Note: I originally thought just annotating the class and constructor would work, but have also tried with a module (hence the comments) Here is the module for providing the Service injections Here is the module that provides the MessageBus (Note I also tried just using commented out annoations above. Next is the App component finally the component for the ViewModel. In the service I have: In the ViewModel I have: When I run this, everything is injected, but I end up with two instances of MessageBus rather than one.

I found some questions, here and here, that have answers that go down a path of implementing ViewModel.Factory and then injecting dependencies into the constructor of a ViewModel subclass that has dependencies via the create method. My question is. Are there any serious issues with just injecting the object in to the Activity (and the Service) and then using a setter to inject the object into the ViewModel after it has been retrieved? For example. In the view class I could check to see if the value has been already be set, and only set it if it's null. "

"Thread-safe Global Resource in Android with Kotlin"," I'm new to Android apps and the activity lifecyle seems to force reliance on globals. (Even with Dagger there are stateful, global Dagger objects that perform dependency injection.) I'd like to make a globally available mode object called . The mode should be changeable at runtime. This is what I have so far: The Kotlin declaration is great for making the global object. It definitely seems better than the singleton pattern in Java. I love how I can declare the global object to implement the interface. What I don't know how to do is make the following part thread safe. If instantiation of is expensive, two threads could cause the expensive instantiation as there is no synchornization inside the check. I thought about doing something like this because apparently initialization is thread safe. The problem with this approach is that once has been assigned, it is permanent. If something happens at runtime to change the mode for the rest of the applications lifetime, still holds a strong reference to the object which means that object can never be garbage collected. It will never be used again but it can never be garbage collected. How can I make the following part thread safe in a better way? Thanks. "

"Using a socket for a custom protocol over tcp"," My protocol looks like this: The problem is, it is my understanding that tcp does not guarantee that an the entire packet as sent by the user will arrive all in one. Therefore, there could technically be a situation, where I don't get the entire message at once, or even that a part of another message is sent with this message. It was quite easy, when I was just assuming that I would be getting the entire message at once, because I just read the first 2 bytes from the stream, made a buffer with the proper size and called however if I start thinking about the possibility of cut-off, I am not sure how to handle it. I tried the following: And I attempt to imitate a message splitting by doing the following from my client socket: however my implementation just hangs in the following line in the second time its ran: I have a feeling I am missing some idea of how Sockets work, however every implementation I have seen, assumes that when the user is done sending he will close the connection, but in my case it's a chat program, so the user will only close the connection when were done chatting. What I would like to achieve: read size read channel read bytes until the buffer of is full parse message notify back to step 0 Edit: After further research, I found that MessageLite library to work with protobuf in Java seems to have methods called writeDelimitedTo(outputStream) and parseDelimitedFrom(inputStream) so it seems most of the work has been done for me.

For saving of data I would like to use a database like SQLite. However, according to another stackoverflow thread, if I want to compile to Kotlin/Native, I cannot use any Java file. If I understand this correctly, it also means that any SQLite library I include is not allowed to import from Java. On the search for such a library, I found two interesting database projects by Jetbrain, namely Anko SQLite and Exposed. However, when digging in their source code, at the time of this writing both import from Java (e.g. java.sql). Which probably means I cannot use them. One idea I had was to use a c-based sqlite library, since according to mentioned thread, Kotlin/Native code is allowed to use c libraries. This may be possible, but I wondered if there isn't a suggested more Kotlin like way of using SQLite or another database in Kotlin/Native? "

My attempts of solving the issue: Obviously, the error of type 1 can be solved by overriding the method of the (making the method return explicitly). This works, but is ugly and should be done by the compiler when it infers the type for . Definitely, something is wrong here. The error of type 2 is a mystery to me, cause the function type (my lambda) explicitly returns Int. I presume it has something to do with Kotlin/Java interoperability. If you have stumbled upon the same issue, please share the experience of solving it. EDIT: Since this bug is not yet resolved, I use slightly different approach to achieve the same result: Instead of setting the value of to lambda, I set it to function reference () like so: And whenever the changes I notify the : In XML layout file, the binding expression looks like: Overall result: messy in the View Model, but clean binding expressions.

"Kotlin: Call a function to update UI from BroadcastReceiver onReceive"," I am new to Kotlin, and it seems awesome!

Now in my (but somewhere else, later on), I want to update my UI when the intent is fired, for example in the function below, the background color changes. The Question What I've tried so far I looked into having a static variable somewhere, storing the result of the BroadcastReciever, then an observable in my UI class, watching and calling appropriate function accordingly. Though after Googling how to do this, looks like that's not really a good approach in Kotlin. Considered trying to run the BroadcastReciever on the UI thread, but that sounds like a terrible idea. Tried mixing a Java implementation with my Kotlin class, but couldn't get it to work. Frustratingly I found several very similar questions on SO. However their implementations seem to all use Java-specific features: Android BroadcastReceiver onReceive Update TextView in MainActivity How to update UI in a BroadcastReceiver Calling a Activity method from BroadcastReceiver in Android How to update UI from BroadcastReceiver after screenshot I'm sure this is a trivial question for most Android developers, but I am lost!

"android multiple realm queries with RXJava"," I'm maintaining an app that I didn't make myself. The app is running on special android device that can read barcodes using a laser beam and once a barcode was entered the app starts checking through lal of the Realms Data base if such code exists, thing is that search queries are many because the app needs to search for both all small letter and all capital letters barcodes. Each database item contains 3 barcodes and once UPC code which the search method needs to iterate on all of them and return an answer. Code below The issue with this method is that it takes long time to iterate on each of those queries and return an answer to the user I thought of integrating RxJava 2 method for this code but couldn't find any useful tips how to do it online. Edit: I Found a solution thanks to Tim Castelijns hinting in the comments which improved the search time by atleast 200% than the old method "
"Picasso binding adapter 'a connection was leaked' message"," I am using a binding adapter to load images in a recycler view. Images appear fine.

"Kotlin override abstract val behavior, object vs class"," I've just started using and started messing with abstract classes, override val's and singeltons. But, I've just encountered a really odd behaviour. My goal was to have an abstract class, and then create several singeltons that extends that abstract class. Since i want to require certain variables i created abstract val that then could be overridden in the subclasses (Instead of passing them through the constructor). So i got 4 classes: MainActivity: Instance: Object AClass: Output: After this I came to the realization that overridden probably are not initialized until after the has been executed. But then I saw what happened when i created a singleton. The value is set in the . Why is this the case? Is it a bug? What is the expected behaviour of singleton and override val?

"Single time events in MVI architecture"," Trying new architecture paradigm where presenter creates immutable state(model) stream and view just renders it. Can't understand how to handle situations where we need to make some event for the one time only. There are couple examples. 1) Notes app. We have and . User clicks , some processing happens and editText should be cleared. Could you guys please describe what will be in our here and approximate logic flow? Questions and pitfalls I see now: We subscribe to in presenter. If we will have in our and render it each render call then we will fall into recursion because it will emit new textChange and will update state and render again. Do we need in to restore it on orientation text or process kill/restore, looks like it works out of box here. But imagine s scroll position. We definitely need to save it to restore. We can't restore it on each render call cause it looks weird, isn't it? If we consider such logic as side effect and will call it makes sense, but do we have reference to view in canonical MVI implementation? Mosby doesn't have it as I see. It makes sense but there is possibility of view being dead in the moment of call. MVI should help us with this but only if it's the part of , right? 2) Github app. First screen(Org): , , . Second screen (Repos): . When user enters organization into and clicks app should make request to API and on success navigate to Repos screen on success or show toast on failure. Again could you please describe for Org screen and what logic should look like? Questions and pitfalls I see now: We should show and disable while loading. We should have like loading/content/error sealed class(lets call it ) and have its instance in our . View knows how to render and shows and disables . Am I right? How to handle navigation then? The same questions as 1.3 and 1.4. I've seen opinions that navigation should be considered as side effect, but again 1.4. Toast - is there something in state or we consider this as side effect? Same problems. Google suggests solution, but it looks weird and then there should be as much streams as we have such things, not really a single source of truth. Others suggest new intent generated from render func which is better but there is a possibility that some async operations will change state again and we'll get second Toast while first is showing and so on.

"Why my RxJava setup is blocking my UI thread? Working with BluetoothAdapter.startLeScan callback"," I am struggling to find the specific action which is blocking my UI thread, i've tried several Scheduler operators, but I'm not sure how to make it work. I have a UI with button, which onClicked is starting bluetooth scan and updates the textView with strings like a log(it shows what is happening at the moment). So here is my MainActivity: Here is the Scanner class: And here is my Kotlin extension functions, which i am using to set Text: Here is also my layout: So the text is appearing in my textView pretty smooth, everything is OK. However, when there is more amount of available devices to scan i can't stop the test by clicking the button. It is just freezed and responding like way too late when i try to click it. The discoverSingleDevice function is will be run forever, because i filter to have the search name from my editText(which i hardcoded with \" \") to make it run forever and i want to only stop this by clicking the stop button in my layout. As a second parameter i passed to it textViewLog from my layout(Kotlin is smart enough to find it by id) So how to prevent blocking the UI with this setup? UPDATE: As WenChao suggested, I've done something like this: However, it not helped, it is not that simple. Again, I've tried several things with other operators. Please, be specific to my case - I provided code. It is like after 2 minutes of scanning the app is rather freezing. In the logs of course appearing I/Choreographer: Skipped 54 frames! The application may be doing too much work on its main thread. UPDATE 2: As PhoenixWang suggested, I've log to check on which thread the BluetoothAdapter runs. So I've done it like this in my scan method in the Scanner class: So how to already fix this? I've thought that it will actually run on the separate thread(not main) because i've done the naive fix, which is visible in my first Update. Can you help? UPDATE 3: So the problem is with the BluetoothAdapter.leScan - it is running on main thread, even if i do something like this: As PhoenixWang suggesting, BluetoothAdapter.LeScanCallback run in mainthread because of his implementation. Observable/RxJava can't change it. So how to resolve my problem? "

The fragments include: But in my fragment's I'm seeing that is still null. Is there anything special I need to do here to avoid calling and instead injecting the view model? UPDATE: After a bit more reading I found that the correct way of using the view model injection in fragments is to inject the factory and get the view model in : This makes sense since I have bound as the and it's annotated with . When I try to compile the above I get the following error: It appears that Dagger can't find the mapping created by the . I'm still at a loss at how that can be. Maybe my tree is incorrect? Why would activities in be able to get the ViewModel but not fragments? UPDATE I've done a little more digging into this...

"Fragment with ViewPager having blank pages after returning to it from another fragment"," In my application I'm trying to create 2 fragments with s. The fragments have 3 tabs/pages each with s and they are supposed to be backed by a database, so I'm keeping them in a . The problem is that after navigating away from the and going back, the view seems empty. Then, if you navigate to e.g. the leftmost page, the rightmost one \"appears\" (when you go to it). This results in the middle page staying empty. (the reason for it being that keeps only the current page and 2 adjacent ones by default. The middle one doesn't get refreshed in a layout with 3 tabs - I tried it also with 5 tabs and I'm able to bring all of them back by going back and forth). After some debugging I saw that the fragments that represent pages don't get removed from the , but the main is. I can't get my head around how really works, even after reading almost all of the source code. If I were able to somehow safely remove the fragments from the , it may work. I've tried some techniques for saving state, but the framework does that automatically (which might actually be the cause of this problem). I'm just a beginner in Android, so there's probably a better way to do this anyway.

The task I want to accomplish is simple: Read the daily step count from the server. Ideally I want the step count retrieved to match what is displayed on  but I have not been able to do so. Here is my set up: Request access: To my understanding the method below should reach out to the server and retrieve the step count. According to the documentation there is method so if I wanted to get the data from the device I would just use that method. But both of these methods seem to return the same exact values. Query Data For context: the step count (at the time of writing this) on  is 6000 and the value I am getting back from the method above is 4 Furthermore I do not see any traffic being generated on the GoogleAPI console for fitness api which confirms the hypothesis that the request is never going out to the server. What I have tried (without success): Manually constructing the request and explicitly adding enable server query Adding subscription for the same data type that I am trying to read How can I read the daily step count data that is stored on the cloud fitness data store?

"Android app clean architecture: Should data layer have its own model classes?"," What´s the best approach when developing an Android app and trying to follow clean architecture guidelines (but not extremely strict - cause that may be overkill for smaller projects). In my case, I am unsure which approach is the best (if there is a best one) regarding the data layer and if the data layer should operate on its own model classes or if it may operate directly on the domain layer models. Also, if the data layer should operate on its own model classes, should data sources like or have their own models (like for an using and a model class with annotations) and then map to data layer models OR should the data layer model itself be the model returned by and (this means the data layer model must be annotated for being able to parse it in case of and ). This is the case in this project:  The following images should clarify the 3 approaches I mean: In Image 1 the and return specific model classes. In the case of the it may look like (using and ): These are then mapped by the Local/Remote data sources to models (which are used by the domain layer). Therefore the repository operates on domain layer models and is breaking boundaries right? That is approach 1. In Image 2 the and still return specific model classes. In the case of the it may look like (using and ): However, these models are then mapped to a data-layer model () which the data-layer operates on. When responding to the domain-layer the maps these ´s to the domain-layer model . This doesn´t break boundaries (right) but it needs some extra mapping in the data-layer. This is approach 2. In Image 3 the and already return the data-layer model . Therefore this model class must contain all annotations needed to parse the API request (with ): If the DB also needs some kind of annotations then these would have to be added to this class too (right?). An advantage of this approach I can think of is that there are fewer model classes (because DB and API directly map to data-layer models). However, doesn´t this blow up the data-layer model class with annotations/properties from all different data sources (DB, API)? Isn´t the whole point of abstracting the data sources from the repository violated then because the data-layer model is dependent on the specific data source implementation (e.g using Gson to parse API request with exact API response names). So this was approach 3. My question is: Which of the 3 approaches is the most flexible and future proof one? "

"Kotlin + Dagger inject issue depending on device's Android Version / SDK (?)"," Last week, while implementing Dagger in my current Kotlin MVP project, I was testing it on oldy phone with KitKat 4.4.2 (yep, it still supports all major material features and stuff :)) due to primary phone's maintenance. So that week I was having typical issues rather than something unusual and fixed them more or less quickly by investigating provided errors. At long last, code compiled, current project version was built without issues and ran without major bugs on KitKat with UI interacting. But when I took main phone with Nougat 7.1.2 from repair center and launched app on it I stuck with weird DI-related issue. Right after that I also launched app on mate's Marshmallow 6.0 and caught one more, exactly the same. The issue is briefly described this way: App (successfully) launches; I'm able to operate ViewPager/DrawerLayout/etc ui features which are provided through context and fragmentManager injection; All services are also available and running through injection as expected; App crashes when i'm twitching Activity's Presenter. And now the funniest part, which drives me crazy: All accessible classes, which don't bring any problems, are injected through constructor injection. But the Presenter instance, which is injected using field injection, is not initialized when needed. Surely, I tried not to use lateinit modifier and to inject it like nullable field with @JvmField or without it: result is the same - it's not injected at all. As the issue is related to , i have the \"natural constraint\" not to use primary constructor for injection. Here is the exception, which is not very informative to me, except the first string: Here is some code: App: AppComponent: AppModule: BaseActivityModule: At the moment i have kinda wide-branching MVP model, so each activity/fragment has 1 View Module and 1 Presenter Module, and all common injections interact through the base classes. Here is the sample of Activity DI parts: BaseActivity: Example of using constructor injection - MainPresenter (all injections work - no problems here): And below is the place where all \"magic\" begins - is not initializing on any circumstances. BUT, as said, that's NOT happening on KitKat - app is running on it without any problems. So, once more: I presume that problem exists when app is running on Marshmallow+ (unfortunately, don't know about Lollipop yet). I really wonder if someone more experinced had issue like this before. No build errors, no dagger exceptions at all; just non-initialized property. Could it be related to permissioning in some way? The only danger permission that i have is device's location acess, and it've beed held and tested. After all, if there is a posibility of supporting/versioning issue, what other aspect could it been related to? Thanks in advance. UPD: Seems that presenter instance is bound to right after its , but un-binds when some callback action with Activity in role of listener is triggered. So, it looks like that Kotlin looks up to presenter again, but finds it uninitialized. Still don't get why this happens only on newer platforms. "

"View not updating after first time triggering LiveData when using background job in Android"," I'm building a debt application in Android using Dagger 2, Room and MVVM. My problem lies with the reactivity of my main view, where a list of debts are shown and you can tick them off. When this activity is launched all the debts are loaded correctly, however when I insert a new debt the view is not updated accordingly. The strange part is that when I tick one of them off the view refreshes as expected. After much debugging I can infer that the problem has to do with the Lifecycle of the ViewModel, because the debts are created using a background job. If I hardcode in the constructor of the ViewModel a new insertion in the database the view updates as expected. Here is my code for the Room Dao: The activity: The view model: What I would like to do is to notify a formatted debt list containing all the information I want.

"How do I notify in Android the ViewModel when a background job has finished creating a new record using LiveData?"," I have an application which from one activity triggers a background job using JobScheduler. This job inserts in a database using Room once it's done. To notify the ViewModel I'm using LiveData. I have set up a main activity which uses ViewModel and everything is injected with Dagger 2. The problem is as follows: when I launch the main activity the list is populated as expected. However when from other activity I schedule a job and said job is finished and a new record has been inserted in the database the main activity does not update. Moreover, if I update a record from the main activity (without using a job) the view refreshes as expected, which makes me believe that the problem has to do with the ViewModel not detecting when a record is inserted using a job. If I'm using LiveData, isn't it supposed to catch all the new insertions? How could I manually notify the ViewModel of the new record? Edit: Repository: Here is the ViewModel: This is the job: More edits: I found out that the instance of the repository on the App is different that the instance of the repository on the background job. This makes the LiveData unable to trigger new changes when there are new records inserted in the DB. So my guess is that somehow I have to check if the app is on the foreground and if so inject the current instance of the repository into the job. If not, then the dependency graph must be created and as the job executes without the app running. Here are the relevant parts of DI configuration: AppComponent: AppModule: Application: If there is anything else needed just let me know. "

I had it sending files successfully but with one big problem... when I sent a file that was too large I got an out of memory exception. So in an effort to find a workaround I began to load and send chunks of the file. It seemed to be working the way that I wanted it too until I went ahead and opened up the received files. One of the first received photos looked like this corrupted image. But most of the other photos, or APK files (whatever misc. \"large\" files) simply don't open at all. I Believe that the problem is somewhere in the logic of my loop that is sending data chunks. Possibly I am missing something simple and just sending the same chunk of data repeatedly? Please have a look at my code below and let me know if you can spot the mistake that I am making. This is the thread that starts the sending: In the a chunk of the file is read int memory, given a header and sent using the function. If returns true, progress is updated. Here is : The send function calls synThread's function. is a ? object. Here is the definition for containing the write function definition: So once again I believe this is a mistake being made somewhere in my loop logic, but I can not see it. Please help me to find this problem and a solution. Thank you.

The size of file before being sent, and the size of file once received. The size of photo being sent is 5.05MB and when received it show as being 526 MB. "
"Draw custom view inside custom view"," I am working on a custom view, , which would display a tree given a root node. I am using the Kotlin language.

However, I want to be able to display an image and text of the person. I have written a compound view called which is able to do this given a object. Ideally, in the future, the user would be able to click on these s in the to trigger an action. So essentially, instead of rectangles, s would be drawn. I have tried creating the view programmatically and setting its layout params like so: I've also tried: In both cases, nothing is drawn instead of the rectangles - it's as if the two code samples above has no effect. N.B. the lines between where the rectangles would be (i.e. connections between nodes) is drawn, and this part of the code has not been altered. So my question is how do I draw a custom view inside another custom view so that I can get the effect I have described? "

"Kotlin: Read Only access of Immutable Type to an Internal Variable of a Mutable Type"," While learning ViewModels in Android, a problem has arisen that feels like Kotlin was meant to solve. In the code below, we can see that MutableLiveData values are being use to edit values and indicators. However, we do not want these mutable values to be exposed to anything else, specifically members of an Android lifecycle. We DO want Android Lifecycle members to have access to read values but not set them. Therefore, the 3 exposed functions, displayed below, are of the LiveData<> immutable type. Is there an easier or more concise way to expose read only values that can be edited internally? This seems like what Kotlin was made to avoid: boilerplate verbosity. A non-Android scenario that might be similar is: "

"Pass data between fragment viewmodels"," Let me just say up front that this is more of a \"structural\" question, and I'm not asking anybody to write code; I'm just trying to figure out how I should be structuring my application. I'm using Android's / for my app. This means that is the host for all my fragments. I currently have three fragments (in reality it's many more, but they are more or less exactly like these three fragments, just for different sets of data). ListFragment DetailFragment EditFragment (used for both adding and editing) On my I have (surprise!) a list of items. This is a collection on (which is tied to 's lifecycle). When an item is tapped I pass the event through to by means of an interface listener. then loads up the . In the same call, I load an instance of (again tied to ). I set to be the tapped item. Then, in 's function, I get the selected item via . On the , there's an edit button. This goes through more or less the same routine described above, but loading up the instead. When the edited/added item is saved, I add/replace the item in 's collection through 's interface listener. Obviously this is not optimal for several reasons. For one, it means that I've got at least five large sets of data hanging around for 's lifecycle (the entire lifecycle of the app, essentially). Also, grows way out of hand as I have to add more and more functions to handle events. What I want to do is have, for example, my list of items on a which is tied to 's lifecycle. My selected item on a , my editing item on an , etc. My problem is that I'm not sure how to properly pass the data around in this case. For example, let's say I add a new item in . How do I get that into 's collection of items? is in the back-stack, so its viewmodel hangs around and doesn't reload the data when it's navigated back to, since it still has the collection from before. This makes sense and is probably how it should be (after all, who wants to wait for all the data to load when they go to and back to ?), but it means that I don't get my new item in the collection. That's just one example, but I'm running into quite a few issues like it (e.g. passing the selected item to .) I'm not quite sure what direction I should even be going here. Can someone more experienced help me out? "

"OpenCV: multiply Mat with Scalar in Kotlin on Android"," I'm writing an Android App, using the Camera API 2.

"Does Kotlin's \"@Parcelize\" work with non data classes?"," I have simple data classes. I mean, they are data classes logically, but not , because I need inheritance and other constructors. They only have fields (of basic types , , or , etc), and constructors. I need to pass them (all of their fields need to be passed) from Activity to Activity, so I need to make them parcellisable (or is there a better way?). I first created them as and just added . Even though there was a warning and red line that said \"CREATOR\" or something, I could ignore them and the app worked as intended. But, now for the reasons above, I changed them to normal classes, and suddenly there is a compilation error. How can I solve this problem? Should I use ? But I need to parse a JSON object to create them. The classes look like these (not actual classes, but simplified for illustration purposes). Is there a better way than implementing that boring, bulky parcellable code by hand? PS. I had to switch to PaperParcel. It was very similar to Kotlin's, but it did not require a primary constructor. It only required the same thing to be any constructor, so I could just create a secondary constructor with the same argument names as those of fields, and it worked. Although, I wonder why the CREATOR could not be created automatically. For example, "

"How to inject a method invocation into another method in android"," I have a class with, a field called , a setter method called , and, a method called which should be called every time is changed. I want to be able to freely add more fields and have the same behavior for all of them. I don't want to manually call because, A lot of boilerplate, Code will be written in Kotlin so I don't want to write setter functions at all. The ideal solution I've been able to think of has been to somehow inject the call right before the for each setter method in compile time. I've looked at annotation processing, but apparently classes aren't actually compiled at that stage, so I'd have to generate the entire class all over again? I don't exactly understand this. The other option seems to be writing a gradle plugin that will find the relevant class(es) and modify their bytecode. I've actually started work on this as a pure Java project (gradle plugin is semi-done) and have been able to find the classes and inject the method call. Can't seem to successfully write the results to a class file though. Here's what I have (using BCEL): Input Java class: Parent Store class: Output (decompiled) class file: Log output: (I checked the index 26 by debugging the code and it is the correct index in the CP) Now, the questions are: Why can't the invocation be seen in the decompiled code but it seems to be added to the instructions list?

Note: If I change the signature of getAnimal() in the DAO to return an Animal directly, rather than a LiveData, then it works so I know it's something with LiveData. "

"RecyclerView.Holder looses information about animation if it's scrolled away (notice it is not recycled)"," I'm implementing an recyclerview and an adapter on top of that (obviously).

How I create my \"bug\": Open app \"Heart\" my item (this is saved in a DB and loaded each time you open the app later). This will activate the animation to fill the heart, the heart will stay filled. If I scroll just so I can't see my item and then back up the heart is \"unfilled\". The item never got to the recycling part, it just got out of vision. The \"unfilled heart\" is the base-state of the animation so to say. If I now click the heart the \"break\"-animation (i.e. unheart) activates as it should. But it goes from unfilled heart -> break-animation -> unfilled heart. Note: I don't want my \"filled-heart\"-state to turn back just because the view goes out of \"visibility\". The state of filled heart is there if my view is recycled and then returned by binding.

Assume I have a fragment which needs a key to use for and . I'm wondering which one of the following 2 options is better: Option 1: Option 2: I'd prefer the #option 2 since it makes it clear that is a constant and the value is determined in compile time. However since it's declared on the top level, it costs a class i.e. (assume the file name is ) to be created in the compiled java code. In #option 1, no extra class is generated and although 's value is going to be assigned at runtime and not constant, that makes no difference in how it's used in this specific case. So although I personally prefer #option 2, my analysis makes me think #option 1 is not worse, if not better. I'm just wondering how other developers think about this and if there are any other benefits of #option 2 that I haven't thought of. Thanks. "

"WeakReference to function type parameter null behavior"," I understand that a WeakReference will allow the garbage collector to clean up its reference if it is no longer needed as a strong reference (such as an Activity being destroyed or ViewModel being cleaned up). But I'm trying to understand a case where my WeakReference to a function is returning a null reference at random points when the function's owning instance hasn't been garbage collected... Consider the following ViewModel: I pass the results of the original LiveData for further processing to an AsyncTask as well as a function type reference to setValue so the AsyncTask can call the mediator's setValue() in onPostExecute(). Consider the following AsyncTask: I would think so long as onCleared() hasn't been called on the ViewModel, and it hasn't been garbage collected, that the WeakReference will always contain a non-null reference. But it so happens that there are two cases I've seen where mOnFinishCallback.get() returns null. While the app is running, restart the app via Android Studio by pressing Run (Shift + F10). The app will close, restart and my RecyclerView which before had items, is now blank. Via some sysouts, I can see the WeakReference has a null reference. While adding new items to the list via a FAB (processes an insert through a DAO instance) and watching my logs, most of the time the WeakReference is still referencing my the MediatorLiveData's setValue() function but at random times it will be null, but the next time I insert an item and this process repeats it is not null. Any idea why this might be? If my ViewModel, and thus MediatorLiveData are still active and not being garbage collected, shouldn't the MediatorLiveData's setValue() function reference be valid the whole time? "

"Unresolved reference for Java file in a different flavor when referencing from kotlin"," Problem: This question has likely been answered implicitly from all the other similar questions but I can't seem to get it to work. If I reference a particular java file in another flavor (different source set) from a java file in the main source set it works. If I try to reference that same file from a Kotlin file in the main source set it complains that it can't see it (\"Unresolved reference\"). If I move the same file to the main source set it works (so it's not the file itself). If I convert the Java file to Kotlin it works (and this is my current solution) but I'd like to know why it doesn't work since it's not always so easy to convert and it should work without converting. Based on my Googling it seems it's related to the source sets in Gradle but I don't want a separate Kotlin folder alongside the Java folder so I'm not sure I need this. Also, another project where I have both Java and Kotlin doesn't have this configured and works fine. I'm using productFlavors with flavorDimensions and have a source set called \"dimension1Dimension2\" (that's where the Java file I'm trying to reference is located).

However, I am unsure of how to design the repository interface for my app. Btw.: I am using MVVM for my presentation layer. The View subscribes to the ViewModel´s LiveData. The ViewModel subscribes to RxJava streams. So I came up with 2 approaches: Approach 1: This approach is primarily using Flowables which emit data if the corresponding data in the underlying SSOT (database) changes (e.g old data gets replaced with fresh data from API, more data was loaded from API, ...). However, I am unsure if using a Flowable for makes sense. As it is like some request/response thing, where maybe a Single might me be more intuitive. Approach 2: This approach is using Singles instead of Flowables. This seems very intuitive but if the data in the SSOT changes, no changes will be emitted. Instead, a call to the repository has to be made again. Another aspect to take into account is that the ViewModel may have to manage its own state. Let´s take the for example (pseudo-code). So this might not be crucial for a smaller app like mine, but it definitely can get a problem for a larger app (see state management:  Finally, I wanted to know which approach to take and why.

"viewModel in Kotlin Android"," I'm trying to understand view models using kotlin for android, and I'm running into some difficulty. I have a very simple dummy app which allows a user to increment a number and then send that number to a second screen. That second screen will then display a random number between 0 and the sent number. Here is the problem. I understand how to send the data from the first page to the second using intents, and I know how to make a viewmodel in the second page. However, if I send the intent and then set the viewmodel equal to the set intent, it doesnt function properly. Rotating the screen will cause the intent to be resent and the viewmodel doesnt maintain the state of the data (the number rerandomizes). Ideally, I'd like to just be able to just update the viewModel class in place of sending the intent, but the instance of the class is created when the second page is created, so that doesn't work. Any ideas? Based on the google codelabs \"build my first android app\" tutorial. Here's my code; first page: Here's my code, second page: "

"onCreate on new activity called multiple incremental times every time startActivity is invoked"," I am working on an android app developed in kotlin that has two activities. Being that activity 1 is the main activity and when an specific layout is clicked activity 2, which is a dialog activity is started. The problem I am having is that each time I click the specific layout on activity 1, the onCreate method on activity 2 is invoked (number of times it was invoked before) + 1 times. Meaning that the first time I click the layout are, the onCreate method is called one time. Then I close activity 2 with finish() and if I click the layout area again, the oncreate method of activity 2 is called two times. If I do that again, 3 times, and then 4, 5, etc. Activity one goes like the below, where I add the onClick listener to layout area: Then activity two goes like the below. Note that it has a button which when clicked closes the activity: The names of the activities, layout, etc are fictitious, but the code is inline with my real code. So, the way I figure out onCreate on activity two is being called multiple times, is because I see the log message \"Starting activity two\" multiple times. Note also, that when btnCancel is clicked on activity two, I also get the log message \"Cancel pressed\" multiple times (as many times as the number of times of the onCreate method being invoked). Your help as always, is much appreciated. Thank you. "
"Kotlin Android Can't Find Class Dexpath"," I'm continuing to try and get a simple tablayout carousel to work with Android Kotlin, and now I'm running into another problem. If you saw another thread of mine I'm trying to get this tutorial up and running:  After fixing the fragment type mismatch (Fragment Type Mismatch in Android Kotlin), I now cannot run the project and I get this error: The problem is the following; Android SDK does not recognize my class as being on the dexpath. The tutorial I linked to unfortunately does not have an android manifest file, but here is mine. Note that very much is referenced, and is called as the class to boot on runtime: One of the solutions that I tried doing instead was to make a main activity page that simply linked to the activity through a button click, and put the main activity in the manifest instead. So this would be my very simple main file: Here I get the error that on line the class is an unresolved reference. This very much does not make sense to me, as exists in the same folder and is a class.

I'd really like to avoid having to specifically use GSON to deserialize into a class every time I make an http request if I just want to pull a single element.

"Kotlin Coroutine to escape callback hell"," I'm trying to use Kotlin's coroutines to avoid callback hell, but it doesnt look like I can in this specific situation, I would like some thougths about it. I have this SyncService class which calls series of different methods to send data to the server like the following: SyncService calls Sync Student, which calls Student Repository, which calls DataSource that makes a server request sending the data through Apollo's Graphql Client. The same pattern follows in each of my features: So every one of the method that I call has this signature: The problem is: When I sync and successfully save the Student on server, I need to sync his enrollment, and if I successfully save the enrollment, I need to sync another object and so on. It all depends on each other and I need to do it sequentially, that's why I was using callbacks. But as you can imagine, the code result is not very friendly, and me and my team starting searching for alternatives to keep it better. And we ended up with this extension function: But the function in DataSource still has a onSuccess() and onError() as callbacks that needs to be passed to whoever call it. The SyncService class code changed to be like: It does execute it sequentially, but I need a way to stop every other coroutine if any got any errors. Error that might come only from Apollo's So I've been trying a lot to find a way to simplify this code, but didn't get any good result. I don't even know if this chaining of callbacks can be simplify at all. That's why I came here to see some thoughts on it. TLDR: I want a way to execute all of my functions sequentially, and still be able to stop all coroutines if any got an exception without a lot o chaining callbacks. "

"Sending Data from Activity to Fragment Using Arguments (Kotlin/Android)"," I am trying to send data from an Activity to it's child fragment. I have one activity that first loads all the fragments like this: here is just an if condition for a tab carousel that supports swiping and clicking tab headers to change tabs. After I load the tabs I call a Fuel http request to get weather data from  a very simple API. I successfully retrieve my local weather and can log the output to the console. Where I am stuck is sending the data to the Fragment. There are a lot of stackoverflow answers to this question. My issue is that I need to do two things: 1) send the data to the fragment, preferably using an argument as this looks simplest and 2) setting some textViews in my fragment to be the value of the weather (display \"It's sunny!\") Here is how I am attempting to solve the problem so far: In my activity, after the data comes back from the http request, I put the data in a bundle and send the bundle to a method inside my fragment class: Here is the fragment I am working with. So in I set the and to items that I have in the layout for the fragment. I have to do this in because this is the only place where is available. I have these as public variables because I need them accessible in my function. My function tries to take the bundle arguments and set them equal to the textViews, however no matter what I do and text values are null, and they do not show in my page in the emulator. I had originally thought that I was experiencing a race condition between creating the tab and getting the data in the activity, so I put in a timeout. However, this does not solve the problem either. Here is the fragment code: Here is the command line output I'm seeing: Note: is the first output, so the tabs must be instantiated before the response comes back from the http request and the call is made. And both setting the weather variables in the activity and of fragment works. But So why are these null? There's no race condition, I can set in successfully. I even put in a timeout. I'm very confused, any hints would help. EDIT: Here is my TabsAdapter: "

"Android Architecture Components GithubBrowserSample unit test understanding"," Hi folks I'm trying to learn unit tests with Kotlin using Google's github browser sample as a base. My code is very similar indeed but I can't get one of their more basic tests to work (and I don't really understand it). My main question is what preciesly is the test doing, from what I can tell, it says: a) When is called, instead of executing the function just return a new live data guy called foo. b) Observe the live data c) Call , which triggers the live data and calls d) Verify the observer to we created earlier has never been fired by any instance of a Resource e) Create a successful foo user, verify that setting it's value triggers the observer So if all of that is roughly correct, my question is on step d). My code is throwing an exception: So I guess is called with a null value. I really don't get what the hell is going on here - calling in step c) triggers the user switchMap live data which in turn calls , so that should call the observer to yet we ask to verify the opposite (that it's never called). After all calling loadUser() returns foo which we specified in a). Maybe if someone can at least explain the test to me I might make sense of my own code! Edit: Here is my own current unit test, the classes and models have changed but as far as I can tell the actual code is identical (I'm aware this can probably be more succinct, will worry about that later!) MockitoHelpers.kt The error is also subtly different: Edit 2, final code: So it looks like my main issue here was the confusion over the different functions, basically I need a null safe call to , ideally one that can specify the matching class. The Mockito-Kotlin library looks like the safest route to go for the moment, because I need an function which will be fallback to the class I specify and I think his version does so: I am assuming the reason the observer is fired with a null value is just something the function does, and that's where Kotlin throws the exception.

"Android and Web App sharing Kotlin code"," One of the major “selling” points of Kotlin appears to be its ability to compile both to JVM or Android and to JavaScript for the web. To make use of this, it should be possible to have a code base where some files are shared between an Android App and a browser Web App. However, so far I found little details on how such a thing would be set up, in particularly when working with Android Studio and its underlying Gradle setup, starting from a a run of the Android Studio New Project Wizard. I don't mind if I can only build the Web App on the command line, but I'd like to maintain the Android debugging hookups that Android Studio provides. So far I know very little about Gradle and typical idioms for its use. I'm sure that I'm not the first person to have this idea, so I'd like to know some best practices on how to set this up. Questions that come to my mind include the following: Do I mix the and the plugin in a single build file, or do I need to have multiple build files (perhaps I should say “modules” or “projects” except I don't know which)? If I have multiple build files, should that be two (one Android one Web) or three (one more for shared things)? If it is two build files, how do I reference the shared sources? If it is three build files, which plugin(s) do I use for the shared one? Do I need to split my sources over three different source trees? Are there any conventions how these should be called? Do I need to split my classes into three groups of packages, or can code for different targets coexist in the same package? What configuration settings do I need to tweak to make the IDE aware of the layout of my project? I've read the following relevant documentation, among other:     "

"Best way to cache data in Android with ViewModel and RxJava2"," In my application I'm using RxJava2 and new class from Architecture Components ViewModel. In my case i need to push SQL clause to ViewModel, which will do some magic and return Observable that will give me data I need. Everything works fine, but I am not sure if I am using RX in best way. My data flow: ViewModel has PublishSubject on which I am pushing SQL's. ViewModel has also Observable which is created by mapping subject. Also I used distinctUntilChanged on Subject, to prevent from executing same query again. To cache data I used replay(1).autoconnect(1) on Observable, but that approach had a flaw. Sometimes my Subject pushed Sql when Observable wasn't yet connect, and my data never arrived to me. Should I use BehaviourSubject? Or maybe i shouldn't use replay(1).autoconnect(1) in first place?

When these criteria are clear, I would apply this to Kotlin. Secondly I would like build a small prototype application. I thought Kotlin Native would be useful but the current version is only v.0.6. So I'm a bit stuck on how I can proof that Kotlin can/cannot be used for cross-platform development. I hope you guys can help me a hand. Thanks in advance Ilias "

"Android Image ID"," I am building an Android(Kotlin) app which gets data from an API. Part of that data is an Image or more like a reference to an Image inside the Android app. Sadly Android does not accept names as arguments for images, so I have to send IDs(numbers). The Problem is that these IDs are changing when you add or remove a Image from the Android App and in general they do not seem to be \"fixed\" or unique. My questions are: Is there a bullet proof way to reference an Image via Text/Numbers? Do IDs change from phone to phone? (Is ID \"213226123\" the same Image on every App where the app is installed?) I could send an Image identifier made by myself and then work with a switch statement to check which image its supposed to be but this makes easy things complicated and would be incredible bad design.

"Kotlin !! Operator usage makes code not clear"," I am writing a Kotlin application, I've been studying this language for a little bit and I noticed that to create a variable you have to explicitly define if it can be null and then you use the ? operator.

This makes my code a mess, because for every line I have at least one !! operator and it looks really unclear if it's so frequent, especially if you have 5 or more variables like that.

"Android Fragment in Layout Losing Listener"," Interesting issue here. Writing an app in kotlin (which is awesome btw) and due to customer design restraints we've had to implement a custom navigation drawer(wish we could use the native navigation view with app:menu but we can't). Embedded fragment In our case we've created a Fragment call NavDrawerFragment that contains a RecyclerView with items and a callback interface that get hooked into in the fragment's onAttach(context: Context) method that lets the activity know the item that was clicked and any additional payloads needed to start the next activity. All works as expected, with the new activities using the same base layout and the fragments listener being implemented by the activity until... the back button is pressed. It appears that pressing back on Activity B calls onDetach on the fragment and when ActivityA resumes it the fragment instance's onAttach method never gets called again. Am I missing something about fragments being embedded into a layout or is this behavior expected? All I need at the end of the day is for ActivityA's implementation of NavDrawerListener to be valid onResume(). "

"Android bluetooth printer - detect disconnection/write failure event?"," I'm writing an application that connects to a bluetooth printer and send it messages. However, I didn't find the right way to detect if there was an error during writing to the printer (such as printer not connected, or disconnected in the middle of writing) Heres the piece of code that writes the message: If i send a message while the printer is disconnected, the code fall to the exception block, which is fine. However, if I send a long message (which takes about 3 seconds to print), The OutputStream.write function ends before the message gets printed. This is a problem, because if a disconnection occures after the function ends, the message won't get printed, and I won't be able to notice it. Couple of things I noticed: When I turn the printer off, after connect to it (connect the socket), the socket.isConnected still returns true When I open an input stream, and then turn the printer off, InputStream.available() still working without throwing an exception The only thing that throws an exception after turning the printer off is the blocking call to InputStream.read().

"How to truncate HTML string, to be used as a \"preview\" version of the original?"," Background We allow the user to create some text that will get converted to HTML, using a rich-text editor library (called Android-RTEditor). The output HTML text is saved as is on the server and the device. Because on some end cases, there is a need to show a lot of this content (multiple instances), we wish to also save a \"preview\" version of this content, meaning it will be much shorter in length (say 120 of normal characters, excluding the extra characters for the HTML tags, which are not counted). What we want is a minimized version of the HTML. Some tags might optionally be removed, but we still want to see lists (numbered/bullets), no matter what we choose to do, because lists do show like text to the user (the bullet is a character, and so do the numbers with the dot). The tag of going to next line should also be handled , as it's important to go to the next line. The problem As opposed to a normal string, where I can just call with the required number of characters, on HTML it might ruin the tags. What I've tried I've thought of 2 possible solutions for this: Convert to plain text (while having some tags handled), and then truncate : Parse the HTML, and replacing some tags with Unicode alternatives, while removing the others. For example, instead of a bullet-list, put the bullet character (maybe this), and same for numbered list (put numbers instead). All the other tags would be removed. Same goes for the tag of going to the next line (\" \"), which should be replaced with \"\\n\". After that, I could safely truncate the normal text, because there are no more tags that could be ruined. Truncate nicely inside the HTML : Parse the HTML, while identifying the text within it, and truncate it there and closing all tags when reaching the truncation position. This might even be harder. I'm not sure which is easier, but I can think of possible disadvantages for each. It is just a preview though, so I don't think it matters much. I've searched the Internet for such solutions, to see if others have made it. I've found some links that talk about \"cleaning\" or \"optimizing\" HTML, but I don't see they can handle replacing them or truncating them. Not only that, but since it's HTML, most are not related to Android, and use PHP, C#, Angular and others as their language. Here are some links that I've found: Java Library to truncate html strings? how to truncate HTML string without leaving it malformated? The questions Are those solutions that I've written possible? If so, is there maybe a known way to implement them? Or even a Java/Kotlin/Android library? How hard would it be to make such a solution? Maybe other solution I haven't thought about? EDIT: I've also tried using an old code I've made in the past (here), which parses XML. Maybe it will work. I also try now to investigate some third party libraries for parsing HTML, such as Jsoup. I think it can help with the truncating, while supporting \"faulty\" HTML inputs. "

"Android Kotlin AAR - Where and how"," I’m a iOS SWIFT developer learning Android development and used to creating Cocoa PODS, as a result of this I using Kotlin and trying to create AAR library files. I’ve created a project and within the project added a seperate module, selecting Android Module as the type. This additional module contains the code that I want to reuse as an AAR library in other apps. The additional module includes resources. So the app and module all build and function as expected but I’m struggling to find the AAR file. If my understanding is correct it should be in the Output folder of the addition module, is this correct. Theres no AAR file is there a specific option I need to enable or way to create the required file? Final question relating to allowing an AAR file or library to have internet access, is there an example of where to add this and the correct syntax?

"Scanning For Wifi Within Custom View"," I have an android app that has a custom view that draws a grid. The custom view is only a section of the main activity's xml file.

I'm able to get the correct grid tile using the onTouchEvent method in the custom view but I don't know how to get that information back to the main activity that contains the view so I can relate a wifi scan with the onTouchEvent and with the x,y tile that was selected. Let me know if I need to provide any more info or any code. Edit: I'll try and simplify the question a little bit. I have an activity whose layout file contains a custom view. This custom view overrides onTouchEvent() and when the onTouchEvent() is triggered in the custom view I need to send some data back to the activity and then perform a wifi scan using the data from the custom view. As Stefan suggested a custom event might be useful, but I'm unsure of the implementation in my case. "

"Android application lifecycle with splash screen and app object"," I'm a newbie in android dev, and after a couple of hours of tests, documentation and forum readings, I still can't manage and understand how to deal with android lifecycle Let's see my app's activity flow (quite classic I guess): splash -> login -> main During splash screen, I need to instantiate and start a 'Shop' object, that will be global to my app and use in all other activities. The start is quite long (around 10 seconds) because is need server authentication, data downloading and data pre-processing. Whenever the application is 'closed', it should be removed from recents app and the shop must be closed (client requirement) If the app is restarted, need to go back to splash activity and re-instantiate the shop For now, what I firstly implemented looked like this: It's not working as expected: First, it's not an android goood practice: the OS should manage itself applications shutdown. Second, even if application is closed, another one seems to be immediatly started after previous being killed. I added the following code to demonstrate: and I continue to have \"APP RUNNING\" in my logs after application exit. (but in another Thread pid) So I just tried to remove killProcess() and let the app continue leaving. The problem is that now, when I restart the app, I directly go to 'login' activity, instead of splash one. Don't know why, my manifest seems correct and on fresh start, I go to splash activity as expected. So if you have any comments on android good practice and way to go for my app, I would appreciate the help! Thanks "

"Base Presenter Test class using Mockito and Kotlin - working around Generic type erasure"," I'm trying to write a base test class with generics to reduce boilerplate code. It's specifically for testing (MVP) Presenters and I'm using Mockito to mock the View interface. E.g. something like this (simplified): This is a problem because type erasure means Mockito can't mock the concrete View type passed in the generic parameter. Attempting to run such a test will produce a at runtime. My current workaround is to add an abstract function to return the View Class so it can be mocked directly in the base class: This means more boilerplate code in the concrete test class which somewhat defeats the purpose of the base test class altogether. It's also the classic Java workaround to generic type erasure. I'm wondering if there's a a better way to do this with Kotlin? (I was thinking reified generic type parameters somehow, but they only apply to inline functions.) "

"How to implement FusedLocationProviderClient as a Service?"," Since this the new Android 8 update came out there are many limitations imposed on how background services work. So my app needs to fetch in background the user's location regularly and for that, I considered using FusedLocationProviderClient suggested by Android Website. After the location has been fetched I just need to some simple work with the info. Right now I developed this sample of code: So I have a question: Q. Should I use a Scheduled Job each time I want to update the location? If I want my app to get updates even if the activity has been closed, it sounds like a Service's job right? But with this new updates, my service doesn't run forever so it will be killed sooner or later. Using a regularly scheduled job, the service will be launched when the conditions are met but it seems kinda weird to schedule regular jobs to update the location instead of using a unique service that makes use of the Interval and SmallestDisplacement for new updates. The requestLocationUpdates() invoke his callback every time the LocationRequest's conditions are met (interval and/or smallestDisplacement in this sample). That's what I'm trying to accomplish, I want a job that requests for location updates, not multiple jobs rescheduled as I need the updates that request for the location. Is there any other better way to accomplish what I'm trying to say or I need this new approach of scheduled jobs? Anyways, sorry for this messy post, it's my first question on Stack Overflow Thanks :) "

"Why poor casting causes ActivityNotFound Exception in Android using Kotlin?"," I recently came across an exception while writing a program and it took me a lot of time to debug simply because I was given a wrong exception by the compiler.

Why using the safe cast operator solved the problem because even without the safe cast operator, my casting was correct? "
"What is a good approach to implementing a real time raster plot on Android?"," What is a suggested implementation approach for a real time scrolling raster plot on Android? I'm not looking for a full source code dump or anything, just some implementation guidance or an outline on the \"what\" and \"how\". what: Should I use built in Android components for drawing or go straight to OpenGL ES2? Or maybe something else I haven't heard of. This is my first bout with graphics of any sort, but I'm not afraid to get a little dirty with OpenGL. how: Given a certain set of drawing components how would I approach implementation? I feel like the plot is basically a texture that needs updating and translating. Background I need do design an Android application that as part of its functionality displays a real time scrolling raster plot (i.e. a spectrogram or waterfall plot). The data will first be coming out of libUSB and passing through native C++ where signal processing will happen. Then, I assume, the plotting can happen either in C++ or Kotlin depending on what is easier and whether passing the data over the JNI is a big enough bottleneck or not. My main concern is drawing the base raster itself in real time and not so much extra things such as zooming, axes, or other added functionality. I'm trying to start simple. Constraints I'm limited to free software. Platform: Android version 7.0+ on modern device GPU hardware acceleration is preferred as the CPU will be doing a good amount of number crunching bringing streaming data to the plot. Thanks in advance! "
"Kotlin views with synthetic binding and nullability"," I've noticed that when using Kotlin's synthetic binding, the view returned is non null (Kotlin will return ). But this doesn't make much sense to me, since can actually return null results, meaning that views can actually be null. So why are they not optional in this case? Why doesn't Kotlin simply return when using synthetic binding, so that developers would be forced to check nullability when dealing with views? Maybe it's just because I'm new to Kotlin, but I think this is a bit counter intuitive, since the variable is not optional but we are still supposed to check if the View is in fact not null. So in this case, does it make sense to do something like the code below? "

"Edit pdf with external application programatically"," I have a request to make my application edit PDF files. Because I found it hard to integrate into the application, I decided to go with the external app and decided to use Xodo reader. The problem I am having is that when my pdf is opened in the Xodo app and edited, it's not being saved to its original location, but rather a copy is saved to the Download folder. To me, this indicates that the app isn't able to save the edited file back to it's original destination, and I believe it's because I didn't do something right. Why do I think this? When Xodo app opens a .pdf file and then edits it when I hit back it saves it to the memory location it is opened from. When I load it with my app, it doesn't work that way.

"buildSrc folder to organize an Android/Kotlin project dependencies/metadata"," Following Google's recommendation of using extra properties to share them through your project, I came across a nice solution based on buildSrc + Kotlin gradle script for my Android/Kotlin projects. This solution provides me very nice advantages comparing to the other classic approach of having multiple Groovy written files per module (plus the root one) with their dependencies, parameters. The main ones are: Using kotlin syntax. Compilation errors. Auto-completion. Click support (navigate to definition) Centralize gradle files metadata information in one file. Check this article for more information. If I'm not wrong, Kotlin-dsl team members recommend to use IntelliJ for it, and the integration with Android Studio doesn't seem to be fully completed, since I still see some Kotlin gradle script code highlighted in red. However, it compiles well. Weird thing is if I clone for example the Prefekt repository I'm able to see the content perfectly without red marks after a gradle sync. I've almost done everything (sync gradle, invalidate cache, remove cache, same gradle wrapper, etc) in my project to vanish those marks without any success. Here are some side questions: What am I doing wrong? What should I do to remove those red marks? Although I like this approach, one thing I'll miss a lot is the outdated dependency check highlight in the gradle file which suggests there's a new x.y.x version of the library. Is there any way to get it work with this approach? Is there any way to use gradle project properties from within the buildSrc Kotlin classes? for example it's very common to work with property files (e.g version.properties) and gradle properties like are very helpful to get their path. We could use for that purpose, but it's not a clean solution. What do you generally think about this approach? "

"How can I get the current location?"," What is the easiest and shortest method to determine the current location of the device in Android? An approximate, city-level location is good enough, and I need the Lat/Long coordinates, not the name. Think of weather location. But I'm using it for sunrise/sunset calculations. All other examples here on StackOverflow and the web are at least a page long and rely on callbacks. But I'm in the middle of a watch face draw function and can't wait for callbacks. I just want to get the last known location that is certainly already lying around somewhere in memory. One answer pointed me to but Android Studio says it doesn't know that method. So it's probably outdated and removed from more recent APIs. I'm new to Android development and don't have a clue where to search. Web snippets brought me here but this time no further. "
"Touch Drag Exit Kotlin"," I have a Swift iOS project that I am converting to Android using Kotlin. I have a particular button that has three events associated with it. Touch Down, Touch Drag Exit and Touch Up Inside. Essentially, what this does is when I tap and hold on the bitton, other items are made visible. When I release, or drag outside the button, the other items are hidden again. Simple: I want to do the same in my Kotlin project. So far, I am doing this: And this handles the event when I touch down and hold on the button the setOnLongClickListener fires and if my finger does not leave the button and I release, the setOnCLickListener fires. However, if I drag away from the button and release my finger, the objects remain visible. Is there another way to accomplish what I am wanting to do? "

"How to make the UI dispatcher resume the continuation immediately"," I've been heavily using coroutines in my Android project. For example, I use them to hand off blocking calls and CPU-intensive tasks to a threadpool. This is where works perfectly: it ensures the continuation resumes on the UI thread. I'm also using coroutines for stuff like awaiting for the first call, resuming the animation loop with a , etc. In these cases the UI context falls short of what I need because it resumes the continuation asynchronously, by submitting an item to the event loop, even though is called on the UI thread. This has become particularly bad in the case where I await the first call on an : I have to reposition the image based on the now-known view dimensions. However, since the coroutine resumes asynchronously, completes, then a few more run, and only then does my coroutine resume. The user experiences flicker because the improperly positioned image briefly appears. Is there an option to force the UI dispatcher to resume immediately whenever is called on the UI thread? "

"How to update the UI after an asynchronous task in an extra class has finished using Kotlin?"," Hy! I'd like to know what the best practice is to update the UI of an Android App with Kotlin once a Volley request has finished and the onResponse handler was called. The way I want to solve the Problem gives me some hard time, so maybe I have the wrong approach... I come from a synchronous world and therefor my approach would be like this: Create a class that fetches the data and returns the fetched data. Once the function returned the data, update the UI. We live in an asynchronous world however and therefor the approach must be different. I still want the data fetching in an extra class. Doing the data fetching in the main class and updating the UI from within the onResponse eventlistener as shown in this tutorial is simple but can't be best practice, right? The data-fetching-class should not contain any reference to the UI, since it should be reusable. How could it be done in a simple yet effective and reusable manner? Please elaborate with examples. Can it be done with something like async/await? Can it be done with something like a hook or an event listener (I'm thinking of socket.io). Could help some way? I was looking this Topic up for hours, but I couldn't find anything useful. So either I'm looking in the wrong places, or the answer is so obvious that nobody asked it before. Some of the answers I found so far were very specific or contained so much extra code that i didn't find it useful. As so many apps are doing just what I want to achieve, this must be an easy task. Any app fetching data from the internet needs exactly what I'm asking for. So I must be missing something. Thanks! "

I know this is a problem with the textview that has the rounds and not the total time, but I can't figure out why. Could someone take a look?

"Request permissions for an Android Wear watch face"," So watch faces are Android Wear apps that don't have any activities but only a service. It's visible and interactive, but a service. And if the app wants to access anything like location or settings, it needs to request the corresponding permissions in code. Adding it to the manifest file is not effective, despite all tutorials saying so. Maybe they're outdated faster than things change on Android. There is the function to check whether the app has a certain permission. This can be called before I do anything. But if it says I don't have that permission, it must be requested. There is the function to request a permission from the user through a dialog view. Unfortunately this requires an activity which a watch face doesn't have. I've seen another question about this issue but it has no useful answers. The answers include external libraries (I've tried the two and none of them works), a code sample in Java that also fails because it extends from that doesn't exist in my version of Android Studio, and otherwise no code. The web doesn't offer any solutions for this and I couldn't find any other web forums where I could ask such questions that would be still active today. My application is written in Kotlin, a supposedly superior and more comfortable language than Java. I'm new to all this and cannot easily convert Java samples to Kotlin. Besides that I can't find any suitable code samples at all. My understanding is that I need to open an activity which can then request the permission. Unfortunately, the Android developer documentation isn't what I'm used to from Microsoft and doesn't cover creating an activity for a Wear app. And it generally doesn't provide any examples that would show how this method must be called. These are the most helpful parts of a documentation and Android doesn't have that. So I'm quite stuck now. Android wants me do something that I'm unable to figure out how that's possible. So how is it possible? What Kotlin code do I need to solve this elementary platform issue and request permissions from a watch face service? "

"kotlin - javascript function is not being called"," I'm building an android app in kotlin with the purpose of sendind user-defined parameters to a robot via JSON. In the side of the robot (which uses ROS) everything is set for receiving JSON objects. However, I'm still having a problem with the app: my app has an activity tasked with receiving the parameters, transform them to an appropiate data type (int or float) and send them to a javascript function which makes the connection with the robot's websocket server and publishes the parameters as a message to a ROS topic.the activity has other functions like resetting the parameters to their default values and going to other activities, but those functions work perfectly. Here's the code of the activity: The problem here lies in the javascript function calling. It's simply not occurring. Here is the HTML code with the javascript function: The conection to the websocket server occurs as the ROS console in the robot recognizes my mobile device as a client upon entering to this activity, but when I tap the button that would call the function, it just returns to the main activity without doing anything (using rostopic echo on the robot shows that no message was published). I tried to test the function by adding a return clause that would return a short message with one of the parameters sent, which would then be shown in the app as a toast, but the toast shows \"null\". Then, when I decided to make the message sending directly (no JS function, with some test values that matched the types defined for the message), the message was published. Is there a Way to solve this? "

"Kotlin-reflect and android gradle plugin 3.1.0"," I'm using org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-reflect library in my project (included in gradle dependencies).

For now I was forced to downgradle android gradle plugin to 3.0.1 to prevent app from crashing. ==================== I've tried to recreate environment causing the crash, however I did not manage to reproduce the crash. Because this happens only on older android versions (pre-L) and after upgrading android gradle plugin that introduces some dex optimisations, my guess is that it's somehow related. ==================== For those marking this issue as duplicate: I'm not sure if can be more clear about that: other ticket is about missing dependency. I have kotlin-reflect dependency in my build.gradle. Moreover my app works on higher Android versions as well as after downgrading the android gradle plugin to 3.0.1. With missing dependency this would not work with any version of android gradle plugin. Therefore the answer from other question is not valid for this one. "

"Android Library & Singleton Context"," I'm creating a library (using Kotlin) and have a requirement to create a String extension that searches an ArrayList and returns a value. As the extension will be called many times I only want to load the ArrayList once and reuse it, so my approach so far is this: Create the String extension, this is working, no issues. The extension calls a function in a singleton which returns the results, this approach is working as I'm manually creating the ArrayList in the init of the singleton. The final solution needs to read a .csv file from the res/raw folder which will then create the ArrayList and this is where my problems start. I'm struggling to find examples of reading a .csv file, currently I have a solution (test application, not a library) that reads the .csv from /app/src/main/assets using the following line of code: Is this the best approach for reading a file, /res/raw seems more logical? Assuming that my current approach is OK as soon as I move this code into my library and use it in the singleton I hit issues relating to context. I do not want the extension to have to pass context to the singleton, ideally I would like the init of the singleton to be able to fetch the context. So in summary... I'm trying to find a way of my Singleton in a library to have access to the context so that the .csv file can be loading into an ArrayList once only. "

If I try to build/debug the project, I get this: I also tried to create a new empty project with the same name into the desired folder and add the layouts and classes there but if I try to run the app I get these: I tried Clean, Invalidate Cache and Restart, deleting and recreating Gradle files as well as most of the solutions provided around here, without any luck.

"Optimize search in list (Kotlin/Android)"," Android, Kotlin 1.2. I have code like I need to filter items list by str so I get sublist which contains onyly items in which str is case-insensitive substring of either field1 or field2 or both (it doesn't matter which one was matched or exact offset). Right now I use code like this: list of items usually contains 2-3k items. field1 and field2 are usually 30-300 usually. Search string is 0-50 chars. Search string changes several times per second (usually new chars added - so abc changes to abcd ). List of items changes rarely. My code have performance on some devices (filter took several seconds which is bad). I can't use .parallelStream (I need to support Android 5.x but devices have usually at least 2 cores). Using parallel map (from Parallel operations on Kotlin collections?) + special flag field in Item + filter does not help too much. I thought about adding hash map with artificial keys (field1+field3) (or sorting list and using binarySearch) but this wont help because search string is not necessarily occurs at start of field1/field3.

"Android 7 app closes when USB device is connected with no stack trace"," I'm using a fingerprint sensor (Integrated Biometrics) through otg cable. I tested my app in a Lollipop device (API 22) and everything goes well. But since i need to test SourceAFIS library which targets API 24, I tested in a NOUGAT device. After requesting permissions for device, the app crashes but there is no error message that i can truly understand: I have tried permission requests at runtime to no avail. While debugging, the code reached a point where execution just stops, again, with no errors in logcat. Full Logcat: App Details: App consists of a state machine that, depending on callback received, it updates UI to enable/disable buttons. App can email the generated image (in png format). I did not find permissions required for this to work, but if anyone knows better, please inform. App saves images generated from sensor, so permission request is executed Since USB is used, \"android.hardware.usb.host\" feature is declared in manifest. In Lollipop device the only permissions listed in App info screen are \"modify or delete the contents of your USB storage\" and \"read the contents of your USB storage\" I'm using libusb library with the prebuilt .so files in armeabi and armeabi-v7a folders inside jniLibs directory. I discarded compatibility issues since while debugging device permission request is shown as granted, but if anyone knows better, I'll take any advice. Things I tried: Disable Hardware acceleration as suggested in this thread Request External Storage (read, write) permission at runtime Debug to see if there are any null values or procedural errors that might affect execution Add add permissions in Manifest and runtime requests Code (Kotlin): So far i haven't been able to find why it is working in lollipop and not in Nougat.

"Best way to arrange multiple fragments on screen and let user interact with them"," [ Visualization of layout and interaction in the middle of the post ] Setup I want to have three fragments/views in my MainActivity: Toolbar (black Stripe on top) SearchFragment - Fragment for searching items (TextView to search on it's top, ListView with results below) MainList - Fragment to display all items (ListView) Currently I am using the ConstraintsLayout to place them in the MainActivity. The user should be able to interact with the fragments/views the following way: Scrolling the MainList up and down is possible as usual If the user clicks SearchEditView, MainList slides down out of screen while Toolbar slides up out of screen. The SearchEditView slides up to the Toolbar's former position If the user scrolls down the MainList while it is already scrolled to the top, the MainList moves up and down with the finger's movement. The amount the MainList was moved by the finger defines the progress. SearchEditView and Toolbar perform their movements described above, according to the current progress The user can also fling the MainList out of screen (which again applys the made progress to SearchEditView and Toolbar as well) This is basically what it should look like (first part: showing the layout, second part: interaction): What I've tried so far I already tried to use a ViewPager and override transformPage(). This didn't work well. I was not able to position SearchEditView, Toolbar and MainList as desired at the same time. Also, it seemed like a very hacky solution as well. So I tried to handle the touch events on my own. Reacted to the overscrolling of MainList, calculated the velocity to detect whether to hide MainList completely or snap it back to it's default position, created ObjectAnimations for SearchFragment, MainList and Toolbar. That way I could come very close to what I want. But again: it seems not very professional to me, as I had to override the onTouch event of the MainList through it's fragment and the MainActivity (shifted the function two classes up the descendant-tree) Question So, to conclude: How can I achieve my aim the best way possible? Means: In a convenient and robust way, without (seemingly) dirty solutions? I don't really ask for all the code, more for the way you would concept something like that "

Last night I tried to build & run it before minor update. So... the whole night is spent trying to figure it out :) The main problem is: It happens each time when i hopefully try to clean-build project with minor changes, none of wich helps at the moment. Current gradle files look as follows: Root build.gradle: Sample's module build.gradle: And lib module build.gradle: As i'm currently stuck with samples module, here is dependency tree output, lightweighted as more as possible: What I tried: Clean-build it with dozens of exclusions and minor transitive dependencies changes; Invalidate cache / restart / clean local cache files; vs vs ; Multidex for tiny lib?:) Tried just to be sure, all the same; Downgrade build version from 3.1 to 3.0 (D8 vs DX compiler): in that case i received even with all dependencies except vital Kotlin removed; See one more below: Actually I'm 90% sure that's about Kotlin as its components are widely used in both modules and it's the last thing I cannot afford myself to be without, therefore I tried to exclude everything from samples module except Kotlin std's.

"AndroidStudio 3.1.1 does not put kotlin classes on the classpath so you cannot run kotlin classes from the IDE"," Below is how this issue manifests if you try to work in the kotlin REPL.

"Android/Kotlin - LAGGY Checking item in BottomNavigationView from ViewPager"," I am fairly new to programming, and this is my first large/real project. --Background-- I have a ViewPager set up within my MainActivity, that slides between 3 different fragments. In Addition, one fragment requires menu items within the toolbar, and a BottomNavigationView is held within the MainActivity. Each time i move to a new item/page of the ViewPager, i want to select(check) the corresponding page item within the BottomNavView. I have attempted multiple configurations of the one below, but can't get it perfect --The Problem-- The time it takes to perform bottom_navigation.menu.getItem(pos).isChecked = true is too long... Approx 50ms on my HTC One, or 100ms in the emulator. This delay causes the ViewPager scrolling action to be jarred/laggy. I would like to know if there is a different way to check or highlight the corresponding item within the BottomNavBar, or more desirably, perform the checking action at the same time without impeding the scrolling animation of the ViewPager. --Attempted Fixes-- Perform check within onPageSelected - (Result is slightly more laggy) Perform check when scroll state is IDLE - (Results in smooth pager scroll, but the checked item is 'left behind' and updated too late, particularly when scrolling fast) Find the navigation item in Anko's doAsync{ } - (Results don't change) I really hope someone has an answer to help with my apps performance :) Thanks for your time.

"Mock ViewModel in MVVM Activity"," Update 29/04/18 Re-titled for better accuracy. Problem is simple: ViewModels cannot be simply mocked on Activities because they are instantiated in an Acitivity's onCreate(). What is the best way around this? Some related ideas located here (unsuccessfully tried to implement) Original question Using Google's MVVM GithubBrowserSample codebase, I am trying to make an instrument test for checking that a loading state throws up a progress bar. Specifically, a mirror of the UserFragmentTest.loading() method. It's pretty simple stuff, I have tried to match my setup closely to Google's. However I can see it's not right. Specifically, I can see functions in my ViewModel (VM) are being called when I explicitly ask for them not to be in my test's function. I am using Kotlin, Dagger2, and the Architecture Components. When I run the test, I can see the code does indeed call nothing (not even the constructor) in the VM. Mine however calls the VM init block (which the sets up), and the getUser() function even though I ask for it to return dummy data. The only major difference I can see is mine is an Activity and Google is testing a Fragment, and the ViewModel mock function is using Niek Haarman's Mockito-Kotlin library. LoginActivityTest.kt LoginActivity.kt LoginViewModel.kt Logcat after running test: Edit: It looks like the issue here is that the VM is not correctly mocked. There's a couple related questions here and here which are having very similar problems. The injected VM factory is first used in the base activity's onCreate, but the activity needs to exist before we can override it to use our mocked VM. "

"Setting RecyclerViews itemAnimator to null does not remove animations"," My outer crashes either with or Like the title suggests I have an in the list item layout of the first . This layout is used to display messages and the inner to display attachments that come with the message. The inner visibility is set to either or depending whether the message has any attachments or not. The simplified outer list item layout looks like this And the part of the adapter that handles the inner looks like this The bug has something to do with the way I fetch the attachments in the inner adapter since once I disable the part that start the download process, everything is fine. There's no problem when loading images from the device, but once I start the download process, everything goes to hell. This is the part that handles images and kicks off the download process in the inner adapter. I have functions for videos and for other file types that are pretty much the same exact thing but use slightly different layout. I use the same structure as above in my to load discussion portraits (profile pictures etc.) and it does not have the same issue. These are the extensions functions used to inflate the viewHolders and to display the images I've been on this for the past couple of days and just can't get my head around it. Any help in any direction is greatly appreciated. I know my explanations can be a bit all over the place so just ask for clarification when needed :) UPDATE I have now been able to produce this with a as well as with . It's safe to assume that the nested were not the culprit here. I even tried to ditch the Rx-piece that handled loading the images and created an for the process, but the same crashes still occur. With I mean that instead of having another adapter to populate the nested I use only one adapter to populate the message and to inflate and populate views for the attachments as well and to attach those views to the nested . The crash happens when I start to download a file and then scroll the view, that is supposed to show the downloaded file, out of the screen. That view should get recycled but for some reason the download process (which in my test cases only takes around 100ms-400ms) causes the app to throw one of the two errors mentioned in the original question. It might be worth noting that I'm using and the adapter takes in a list as it's dataset. My presenter looks for changes in the list and then notifies the adapter when needed (changed due to the implementation of ). This is how I'm capable to reproduce this time and time again: Open a discussion that has messages with attachments Start to scroll upwards for more messages Pass a message with an attachment and scroll it off screen while it's still loading Crash There is no crash if I stop and wait for the download to complete and everything works as intended. The image/video/file gets updated with a proper thumbnail and the app wont crash if I scroll that out of view. UPDATE 2 I tried swapping the nested for a single just to see is the problem within the nestedness. Lo and behold! It still crashes. Now I'm really confused, since the I mentioned before has the same exact thing in it and that one works like a charm... My search continues. I hope someone, some day will benefit from my agony. UPDATE 3 I started to log the parent of every in the function. Like expected I got after after , before the app crashed and spew this out. There's a method to my madness after all! But this just poses more questions. Why is used here? As a part of RecyclerView or as a part of the dark magicians plans to deprive me of my sanity? Sidenote I went digging into code to check if I could find a reason for the mystery. I found out that calls the adapters function only twice. Both times providing itself as the argument for the function. So no luck there... What the hell can cause the item view to have the as it's parent? The parent is an immutable value, so the only way for the to be set as the parent, is for something to construct a new and supply the as the parent object. UPDATE 4 Sometimes I amaze myself with my own stupidity. The is used because the items are being animated. I didn't even consider this to be an option since I've set the for the as , but for some odd reason that does not work. The items are still being animated and that is causing this whole charade. So what could be the cause of this? (How I chose to ignore the moving items, I do not know, but the animations became very clear when I forced the app to download same picture over and over again and the whole list went haywire.) My contains the RecyclerView in question and a nested ConstraintLayout that in turn contains an for user input and a send button. This is the piece that handles the initialization of the . I'm most definitely setting the as , but the animations just wont stop! I've tried setting the xml attribute on the root and on the but neither of them worked. It's worth mentioning that I also checked whether the had an in different states of the program, and every time I check the animator, it is null. So what is animating my ?! "

"Add icon button to the right side of the Notification"," I think that the usual way to display actions in android is a little bit hard to tap and to be found.

The only way I found to to this is to use a , but it has some issues: It creates a notification, but its all black I don't want it to be expanded like this I want to add the usual action (a cog icon, shortcut to the config screen) The code I've got so far: Will I need to implement a custom layout for the notification?

"Usage in Activity separate class which creates Buttons with set onClickListeners on Android Studio"," I need to build app with 6 Activity screens and custom navigation tabs in a bar below them (all must have both icon and label).

Next I want to make them clickable in each activity and set listeners on them. At first I manually set listeners on them in each activity like: It works well but the same code was written 36 times and it is not well. So idea was to make separate class which defines this buttons and sets listeners on them and each activity only imports them. I tried to write something like this: NavHelper: Activity: But in this case buttons are not clickable (No effect on click and no click animation at all). What is the right way to use such class? "

"Unresolved reference to function in custom class"," I am unable to solve a seemingly trivial issue. My problem is probably my lack of experience (and understanding) of the Kotlin language. Nevertheless, I'll be needing help with this. I made a custom class, containing a custom function. It seems simple enough, but I keep getting the \"unresolved reference\" error when I try to use this function. This piece of example code reproduces the error: The error reads The class may not make a lot of sense like this, but it is intended to mimic the structure of the actual class I am using in my app. I feel I'm making a terrible rookie mistake. I've searched on Stackoverflow and Kotlin documentation, but I can't seem to find a solution. I tested the above code on try.kotlinlang.org, by simply replacing the \"hello world\" example. #### EDIT I'm afraid the context of the app I'm trying to build might be important after all. I'm trying to implement a Room database, but the clearest tutorial I could find is for Java, so I'm trying to translate and that makes me run into trouble. This is the page I'm currently following: Room Database. I need the \"Test\" class here to be a singleton, that's what the actual contents of \"getBla()\" were for. To get to actual problem, here's what the actual class looks like now: So needs to be a singleton. The problem arises from the automatic translation of Java code into Kotlin. It seems this situation is a bit too complex for that. I tried to find an answer by searching for various combination of \"Kotlin\", \"Singleton\" and \"abstract method\". Eventually I stumbled upon this blog: Kotlin singletons with argument. What I needed was a singleton that takes an argument, which apparently was not a trivial thing to do in Kotlin. This blog explains how to implement such a construct. My code now at least compiles, if it actually does what I want it to do I'll find out later. My current implementation is somewhat like this: SingletonHolder.kt (To build singletons taking arguments) BoxRoomDatabase.kt BoxRepository.kt Even though this compiles, it might not be the best way to go about doing this. If anyone has any input on the structure of the above code, feel free to share your input. "

I can't launch the whole coroutine on the UI thread though, because the login call will block since it's on the UI thread and messes up my animation (which makes sense).

"Change color on fragment canvas when clicked from Activity"," I am making a children's app where the child can fingerpaint on a book spread as seen below. The main view is not an ImageView. Rather, it is a custom view extending from GLSurfaceView to allow a pagecurl animation when flipping pages. In order to make a canvas, when a crayon is clicked, my code launches a fragment with a transparent layout to enable drawing on top of the custom view. It works for each separate color. But when a new color is clicked, the old lines are removed (because a new fragment is launched) and I can draw again using the new color. However, the ideal behavior is that the old drawing is retained (using the previous color), and the user should be able to keep on drawing with the new color without the fragment being re-launched. As a test, I've only used the first 3 colors for now. In the DrawingFragment, I've actually been able to change the color programmatically from the fragment (to CYAN) by calling the method . However, I still need to get the click event from the Activity that corresponds to each color. Main Problems: App should launch the fragment only once on the first instance any crayon is clicked. App should identify if the fragment is already created, and if so, pass the button click event from Activity to Fragment each time a crayon is clicked. I have a vague idea that maybe I should use an interface but I've yet to fully understand what this does. I'm pretty new to kotlin and android and any help or suggestion will be greatly appreciated.

"Why is List.toFloatArray so slow compared to filling a FloatArray? (bug?)"," In my Android phone application there are many large Lists of Floats (100000+). In order to use them with OpenGl, the Lists are converted to FloatArrays and then to bytebuffers. I ran into performance problems and after many hours, it seems that the Kotlin .toFloatArray() function is very slow. Some test results on my Samsung Galaxy Phone: Filling a floatarray with values is fast and filling a List with floats is 7.4 times slower. However converting the List to a floatarray by the standard function List.toFoatArray() is 6.1 times slower than simply filling the array, it is also 2.4 times slower than looping over the List. It is almost as slow as filling an empty List with Floats! I expected a conversion time closer to the time of simply filling the array? Does the performance of .toFloatArray() make sense? And what is the fastest or at least a faster way to convert a List to a Bytebuffer? Below the small test program, for reference. "

The plugin will generate some extra code that will allow you to access views in the XML layout, just as if they were properties with the name of the id you used in the layout definition.

The problem is that I can't specify which List type the MatchesDeserializer should be used for, as a class literal can't include type information. We can specify type for an Array response without issues. I could change all calls expecting List to return JsonObject, and parse it with my deserializer manually, or implement a TypeAdapterFactory to manually deserialize only User types.

"Issues while translating a static method to kotlin from java"," I am trying to understand and translate a java code to kotlin. The code is available here. Basically there are two class files : Allows user to select an from a ListView : Performs read/write operation on the selected The relevant code section from is follows: relevant code snip from is follows: The part I am not able to understand is how is the static method from able to retain the object being passed? There isn't an instance of the parent class involved (which is also the whole purpose of static method). To achieve a similar effect as above I wrote following code, but it doesn't work: sPort is not accessible from inside the show. If I move the function outside the companion object, Then I cannot do the following The \"devious hack\" warning in the original post suggests to recreate the driver by passing arguments, but alas, it is not clear how would one create an port object from arguments. Another option is to implement a serializable object (because port is not yet serializable) and pass it via the intent but I'm not yet versed with serializing. Thus, I am looking for a similar work-around as done in the original work in \"kotlin'y way\". Kindly Help. "

"Dimensions of UI elements are 0*0 when called from callback methods"," Where would testSizes have to be called from for calls inside it to log the right dimensions for elements inside a fragment and for the call to happen when the appication is opened? visualizerIV height used as an example. Full story: I am using an image view to draw interactive mathematical functions. Everything works as long as my application calls the drawing method from a listener attached to an UI element, but none of the automatic onSomething functions don't seem to be work as triggers. After debugging with the sample method, I found out that the height of my imageview is 0 or null if testSizes is called from onViewCreated, onActivityCreated and onStart. But if I touch an UI component with a listener calling for testSizes, I am getting height of 356px. Now since the height(and width) of my IV are important for drawing a bitmap onto it, a bitmap with the correct dimensions can't be drawn and set as the content of my IV and the IV is left as a white box until the user interacts with the UI.

"Class inheritance and parametrized types in Kotlin: Is Subtype Polymorphism possible with generics?"," I'm struggling to understand and/or make Kotlin generics & polymorphism work for me.

The Context I'm implementing the networking code to perform CRUD operations against an API that's based on the JSON API spec format, thus I created the attributes and data () classes to represent the json response objects. My goal is to reduce the amount of duplicated code so that I only have to write the API service declarations once for every entity in my application (fruits, vendors, buyers, etc). I also want to avoid writing duplicated/boilerplate implementations of the data repository layers for every entity in my app (in the context of clean architecture). I should be able to just specify the business entity-specific types (models/entities) and let the one generic implementation do the work of fetching network data. I thought it would make sense to use generics and inheritance to achieve this. In this particular example, the idea is that the fruit-specific GET would return a fruit response list, which is a subtype of the base response list. Will greatly appreciate any guidance on this, or alternative approaches to this problem "

"Should I have a single POJO class representing all possible columns returned from a Room Table?"," This is currently my data class in Kotlin representing a File. Room is able to return columns by constructing POJO's that you specify in the return type as long as the column info matches. Depending on the use case, such as showing the model as a view or storing it, I require different columns. Should I create POJOs for each of those cases or use the one below since I can have null fields? My concern is primarily memory, since null values still create pointers that occupy space. Maintaining different POJO's and updating them is a hassle - requires converters and factories. But the following model could also get bigger. "

I've tried using styles that set these values in them, but android studio still complains if I don't define the attributes for each view, even if it is defined in the style already. I know there are similar questions to this already, but they are older and none of them had a conclusive answer one way or the other as to whether it is possible or not.

"Facebook only showes image preview for a deeplink sometimes, even though the images are always uploaded and exist on the server"," My app handles photos in an offline manner. When a user wants to share a photo they press the share button, then the photo is being uploaded to the server (Firebase storage) and a deeplink to it is generated (via Branch). the problem is, when the link is shared there isn't a preview photo always, just sometimes. The same goes for Messenger and Whatsapp. Instead of a preview of the photo being shared, it shows a photo of the app logo (from the branch settings I assume as I've uploaded one there. I can not find any pattern to when it shows and when it doesn't. All the photos, even those who do not show a preview, exist on the server. I have tried using Facebook debugger but still no preview. Another probably part of the same issue - a photo link the receives a photo preview on Facebook or messenger, gets no preview on Whatsapp what so ever, even though a link that doesn't get the preview on Facebook/Messenger (just get's the app logo as preview), also gets the app logo as preview on Whatsapp. The app was built by a freelancer that is unfortunately unavailable anymore for work.

This was confusing because my app's file has the following two lines: This brings me to my first question, how can I use the method in the ion library? I thought that maybe I had to manually download AsyncAwait.kt, which was the only file in the source folder of ion-kotlin. So, I downloaded that file and placed it in my project's package. I changed the package declaration at the top of the downloaded file from to . That seemed to partially solve the problem because I no longer had the \"unresolved reference: await\" error in Android Studio. But, the file AsyncAwait.kt refuses to compile. I am getting several errors. One of the errors is occurring at an import statement at the top of the file. The error is: This brings me to my second question.

"Communication Between Two Android Activities via Reference to Caller or Callee"," I have two activities Activity A and Activity B inside of the same application and they need to be able to call methods on each other. A needs to communicate to B at the start (possibly see \"code\" below). B will call a lot of methods on A (this means that I cannot use the startActivityForResult method for communication because this would close B (Activity B is a Bluetooth Client and Server because it is a Peer to Peer app)). I do use startActivityForResult to start B for more of a kill signal than anything as the result. Activity A uses a SupportMapFragment and Activity B cannot be a fragment because I want to be able to switch from B to A and then never use B again. Originally, I started with one activity and tried switching between views using a ViewFlipper and just a call to setContentView(R.layout.my_layout_A) or setContentView(R.layout.my_layout_B). The fragment of course caused a lot of problems for both. Using Fragments were confusing. The SupportMapFragment is the code for a Google Map which is a Fragment. When I click a menu option inside of the MapsActivity (Activity A), I would like to be able to start myBluetoothActivity (Activity B) with a reference to the MapsActivity (Activity A) OR start myBluetoothActivity and then be able to set a reference to the caller inside of myBluetoothActivity (but this option would require having a reference to the BluetoothActivity inside of the MapsActivity or having some way to obtain the started activity from the intent). How can I accomplish this communication between the two activities via reference between the two activities? Should I use an interface for communication? If I should use it, (which I did try) how should I? In other words, I am trying to access the caller activity (Activity A) from (Activity B) directly via a reference to Activity A inside of B OR trying to get the reference to B from the intent that started it inside of Activity A. I am trying to get a reference to that, so I can use it for communication/method calling/member variable and UI modification purposes. NOTES: 1. The BluetoothActivity and the MapsActivity are NOT SERIALIZABLE. I tried serializing it and then adding it to the extras Bundle in the Intent and it just crashed saying that that was impossible to serialize due to BroadCastReciever. As this also deals with WIFI. Which I am highly considering separating out to be put with the BluetoothActivity in a future release. I am also ASSUMING that Activity B will never just be started up by anything other than my MapsActivity class. I am also new to Kotlin, but I know Java. When I tried using an interface, I caused a StackOverflow error and I have no idea why. I have read the documentation for Intents on the website. I have done some research on here which gave me those ideas above. I am not sure how to implement them. "

"How can I work around AppNotIdleException for a view that redraws every second?"," I'm testing an Android application with a meter graphic where an element on the screen (the meter) is redrawn every second. The idea is that I tap a start button and the meter turns on, and when I tap a stop button the meter turns off. Manually it works fine, but when I run my Espresso tests, the test hangs after I tap start because the app never idles, as it is being redrawn every second. As expected, I get: android.support.test.espresso.AppNotIdleException: Looped for 13452 iterations over 60 SECONDS. The following Idle Conditions failed . I found noActivity() in the Android Developers docs, thinking that may be helpful, but I can't figure out how to use it properly nor can I find any good examples. The stop button is clearly on the page but this step is bypassed and it goes straight to tearDown(), which tells me that I'm not using it correctly or I don't understand what it's doing: So how do I overcome this? Is there an easy way to tell Espresso to not use idling resources for a certain test, or part of it? Do I need to write an idling resource that says when the stop button is found, the app is idle? Is there another method I could be missing? FWIW I'm using Kotlin, but I welcome Java answers as well since they're so similar. Thanks! "

"Do I really need to use kapt when there is no kotlin code?"," The reason of this question is the next one: I have been using this library to make classes parcelable in Java, and I decided to migrate all the model to kotlin classes. Reading some documentation I realised that I needed to use KAPT instead of \"annotationProcessor\". The problem: The thing is that later when I was trying to run the app, I started to have problems with Dagger 2 and Butterknife which were using \"annotationProcessor\" as they are dealing with JAVA classes, not Kotlin classes. To get things working again I had to add a new line in my gradle file for every \"annotationProcessor\" but using \"kapt\" instead. So my question is: Do I really need to do this if the code involved in using those frameworks are pure java classes? Can you explain me the reason of this in case I need to do it?

RoomDatabase class: DAO: Dagger Module: I'd like to be able to access my DAO in the onCreate callback. It seems obvious that this should be possible because Google is pushing Room and Dagger together and this is likely a pretty common use case. I've tried providing the DAO as a constructor argument for provideDB, but that creates a circular dependency I've tried initializing my RoomDatabase as a companion object. Then instead of using the Room.builder format in my provideDB method, I can call a getInstance method that has access to the DAO. But this way I'm met with an error for a recursive call to getWriteableDatabase. I understand that I can use something like db.execSQL, but it seems like such a shame to do that when I'm using Room. Is there a better way that I'm missing? I'm using Kotlin, but Java examples are welcome. :) "

The second fails the moment you try to use a scheduler. Here's a sample of the second: What I expect this to do is stop the moment that returns an empty list. Instead, it continues hitting the endpoint for an indeterminate number of times, with incrementing page values. I have experimented a bit in unit tests with and determined that the problem appears to be the fact that my service is automatically subscribed on . This is how I define my Retrofit services: It's really not an option to not use here. Here's another idea I tried: This is another case where it worked as expected right up until I introduced a . The generator generates way too many values, when I'm expecting it to stop when the discovers an empty list. I've also tried various kinds of (concatWith, concatMap, etc). At this point, I'm really just looking for someone to help me correct the obvious (to them) and completely basic misunderstanding I clearly have with RxJava operators. "

"Android: is it possible/advised to interact with a Bound Service from Adapter?"," I have some complex data modeled by a data class, with both immutable and mutable fields: And I'm trying to find a way to display a number of instances of it in a RecyclerView. I reckon the Adapter's only concern is to display data, however, passing a whole bunch of objects doesn't seem really sensible to me, expecially since not all the fields of all the instances would need to be displayed. So I decided to use a list of ISBN as the Adapter's DataSet and, when needed, fetch the corresponding object from a Bound Service. However, I'm not sure this is the right way, as the Adapter doesn't have a clear Lifecycle, and I can't figure where to bind/unbind to the service. The question then becomes: In an Android Adapter, where should I bind to a Bound Service, in order to fetch the data to display? Is doing so some sort of design heresy? "

When I turn off the GPS I would get the messages , which is fine. But when I turn the GPS on I would get no messages at all. What is more the promise is neither resolved nor rejected. I could toggle GPS many times and let's say on about 5th time all the promises would be resolved with a current location, then I repeat the process and again and have no location at all. Sometimes launching another app that uses GPS, for example would instantly resolve all the promises and sometimes it doesn't. Often toggling GPS on and off would cause no issues and sometimes it would many. Sometimes turning off the Network would have been causing this problem for like 15 minutes and later on it would have no affect. Did anyone have such problems with GPS?

"Save Animated Drawable to GIF File?"," I am trying to make an image keyboard with the Android Commit Content API. In order to implement this, I need be able to store and files on the device and create file objects from them. Currently, I am using the Glide library to fetch images from the internet. An example image I might fetch is this. The Glide library provides me with that contain animated GIFs. I need to be able to encode these drawables into files that can be saved as files on the user's phone. How can I do this? I've looked at existing posts, such as this: How to convert a Drawable to a Bitmap?, but they aren't helpful because the object cannot store animated GIFs. This post: saving gif file from drawable into phone sd? and remove it from sd after usage also seems relevant, but, it doesn't explain how to turn an animated object into a list of objects. Also, it doesn't explain how to save a series of objects as 1 GIF file. "

"RxJava 2 + Room Transactions: Return single Disposable in transaction of two rxjava opertions"," I am using Room database and RxJava. I need to delete all records from a table and then insert new set of entries. A way to do this would be: returns a disposable and returns a disposable. However, I would like to return a single Disposable from this method. Although I could return a CompositeDisposable. So what I though of is: This will return single disposable. However, would this be transaction? Lets say, for whatever reason, failed and onError is called. Would Room actually revert deletion of all records for me? If not, what would be the correct way of achieving this? Or is returning a is the right way? "

"Glide - Save GIF to File"," Sidenote - although some of my examples are in Kotlin, answers in either Java or Kotlin are helpful. I'm creating a GIF keyboard using the Commit Content API. To do this, I need to be able to create files. I'm using Glide to fetch the images from the internet and display them in a list inside of a . For each image Glide downloads, I have to create a object with the data of that image. I see two methods that could accomplish this objective. 1] Create a listener that overrides like so. The problem with this method is that I don't know how to convert a to a file because all the Stack Overflow posts talk about how to convert a to a file: 2] Load the image to a or something similar. Example Java code, taken from the post Glide - download and resize GIF into a file, could look like this. The problem with this code is that A] is deprecated B] there is no method C] I don't want to specify the dimensions of my GIF - I'd just like to use the original size. (Or, at the very least, I'd like to preserve the aspect ratio) Can someone help me improve either of these two methods, or suggest a new way to convert a GIF to a file with Glide? "
