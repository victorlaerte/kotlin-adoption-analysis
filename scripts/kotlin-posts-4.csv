Understanding traits in Kotlin In Kotlin we ll have possibility to create a  trait that may require a class being extended on the call side   like I can t imagine any flow where I can apply this structure  Can anyone tell me why we need it 
Reified generics in Scala 2 10 The lack of reified generics in Scala is the thing that bugs me the most about the language  since simple things cannot be implemented without using complicated constructs  Both Kotlin and Ceylon supports reified generics so its definitely possible to do so on top of the JVM  In the past it was said that Scala could not support them without a change in the JVM  but now Scala 2 10 is rumored to have limited support for reification  So my question is  What can we expect for reification in Scala 2 10  will I for example be able to implement a generic trait multiple times    Just how limited is it   If Scala 2 10 s reification turns out to be more limited than Kotlin and Ceylon  Why is that  
Reason for precedence of operators with a type on the right hand side  gives the operator precedence table for Kotlin  including the operators with a type on the right hand side    and   which have precedence in between the multiplication and prefix operators  Is there a reason for giving them that particular precedence  I can t offhand think of a situation where it would be necessary advantageous  what am I missing

Custom Android views with Kotlin I m trying to use Kotlin in my Android project  I need to create custom view class  Each custom view has two important constructors  is used to instantiate view in code  and is called by layout inflater when inflating layout from XML  Answer to this question suggests that I use constructor with default values or factory method  But here s what we have  Factory method  or Constructor with default values  How can this puzzle be resolved  UPDATE  Seems like we can use superclass constructor instead of   so factory method approach seems to be the solution  But even then I can t get my code to work  or

Java modifies kotlin class content to null Kotlin has a brilliant null checks at compile time using separation to  nullable   and  notnullable  objects  It has a KAnnotator to help determine that objects coming from Java are nullabale or not  But what if some part of not nullable class is changed  Consider we have a cat  which certainly has a head that can meeew  When we ask the cat to mew  it mews with its head  Now lets add to this pretty picture a JAVA cat maniac  CatManiac java   who cuts off a cats  heads as he gets  So if we pass a cat to a maniac  he definitely cuts its head  And how cat says mew without a head  We get a runtime error inside kotlin because of null  at point of calling cat mew    I believe it is a pretty common problem we can get while using Java libraries in Kotlin  Is there any way or any plans to warn fight with that  P S  Something like KAnnotator looking for such things in your code

How to assign a null value to a function type variable in Kotlin  I have a variable that holds a callback  and by default it s value should be null  But this syntax doesn t seem to work  My current solution is to make sure that callbacks have default implementations  This  however  makes it hard to check whether or not the callback was set  and possibly default implementation comes at some cost  is that so    How to assign a null value to a function type variable in Kotlin

Bug or Feature  Kotlin allows to change  val  to  var  in inheritance I just started to explore the language Kotlin  I m struggling with inheritance  var val and side effects  If I declare a trait with a and override in it is possible to override it as  see code below   Surprisingly the method in is affected by the reassignment of even though is a value in   Is this a bug or a feature  Code  I m aware of the fact that if I define with type explicitly it is not allowed to change   But as the first case shows  inheritance can cause side effects which are clearly not intended in   How do I protect values from being changed by inheritance

Using Kotlin function as Java SAM type When calling methods from a Java API that expect SAM  single abstract method  type arguments is there a consistent way to coerce a function literal to the correct type  I m finding that sometimes Kotlin functions work just fine and others not without any seeming consistency  I have a couple of examples from the Ratpack API  When calling using a Kotlin function literal works fine  e g   Type inference picks up that is a correctly  On the other hand I m trying to call and can t figure out how to get a Kotlin function to stand in for the second argument  Is this down to the generic type making life difficult  Maybe I m expecting Kotlin to do something that it s not designed for but the first example shows that at least some SAM type coercion is possible  Kotlin fun to Ratpack

Generating jar for JavaFX project in Kotlin While I was playing around with Kotlin I wondered if I can generat a jar for a JavaFX app written in Kotlin  So I wrote a simple app and it worked on IntelliJ IDEA  but when I decided to generate the jar it never worked  It says that it can t find or load the main class  I guess the problem is that when it asked for the main class in the project settings I entered the application class name  which doesn t contain the main method  as it has to be at the package level  while in pure Java I could just put the main method inside the application class and it would work perfectly  So how should I get around this  EDIT  just tried changing the target from JavaFX Application to a normal Jar and it worked  Don t know why it s not working with the JavaFX Application target

Extend data class in Kotlin Data classes seem to be the replacement to the old fashioned POJOs in Java  It is quite expectable that these classes would allow for inheritance  but I can see no convenient way to extend a data class  What I need is something like this  The code above fails because of clash of methods  Leaving annotation in only one of classes does not do the work  too  Perhaps there is another idiom to extend data classes  UPD  I might annotate only child child class  but annotation only handles properties declared in the constructor  That is  I would have to declare all parent s properties and override them  which is ugly

How to store temporary variable while initializing a Kotlin object  I m studying Kotlin and as part of learning it I want to design a class that would represent a rational number  requirements  Class should contain two immutable integer fields  numerator and denominator  Class should contain valid equals  hashCode and toString implementations  When class is initialized  numerator and denominator should be deleted by their GCD  it means that etc   This class should contain mul method that takes another Ratio and returns multiplication result of the current ratio and the given one  I tried to use data classes what looked suitable for that task  but I was stuck with inability to define a custom constructor  both numerator and denominator need to be deleted to their GCD   Possible solution  What is the simplest way to define a class constructor so that GCD is calculated once  UPDATE OK  it looks like I found the possible solution  but it renders that data qualifier useless   after this change Ratio class no longer has auto generated equals hashCode toString  Verified on the latest version of Kotlin   0 9 66 Program that reproduces that behavior  output  that s clear that Ratio no longer has auto generated toString method

In Kotlin  how do I extend a class that has multiple constructors  I am in the processing of learning Kotlin  and ran into a problem I couldn t figure out  I would like to extend the Java class RuntimeException in Kotlin  and be able to use any one of three of it s constructors  in different circumstances  based on what info I have at the time I want to throw an exception   In java my class would look like this  When I try to do this in Kotlin  I used this answer as a guide  Kotlin secondary constructor however  I had a problem trying to figure out how to invoke the appropriate super constructor correctly  For example  using functions seemed to be a good approach  like this  However  in this Kotlin example above  I am always invoking the super constructor with two args  and not invoking the constructor most appropriate to the situation  So what I have above works  but doesn t do exactly what it would do in Java where a different constructor is invoked in each situation  I also tried instantiating a new RuntimeException inside each fun above  and casting it to PhotoLibException  but I wasn t allowed to do that  Can anyone suggest how I would do this correctly in Kotlin

JAX RS  Apache CXF  Context injection via setter I m trying to inject HttpServletRequest to my JAX RS resource  Apache CXF implementation  via  Context annotation in Kotlin  It works fine if I inject it via method parameter  But I don t want to  mess  my interfaces with that so I d like to inject it via field setter  The thing with plain field injection is that the proxy has $ in its name which is an issue for kotlin as it is not able work with class names with dollar in name  So I m trying to do it via setter with this simple method  The thing is  and I believe it should be an issue in Java too   that the setter is called via reflection in org apache cxf jaxrs utils InjectionUtils in method injectThroughMethod that throws java lang IllegalArgumentException  object is not an instance of declaring class I tried to google this issue but with no luck  Did anyone had similar issue or is there something I m doing wrong  Btw I also created an issue in JIRA of CXF

Kotlin reflection interoperability with Java What are the caveats that a developer should be aware of while writing reflective code that works both with Java and Kotlin  For example  I have an existing library that uses reflection and it works well with Java  However  when I use the same with Kotlin  my reflective code doesn t seem to pick up the annotations on fields  Here are some of the differences that I noticed  1  Acquiring a Class instance Getting a Java class instance in Kotlin I m unable to use the facility or the method in Kotlin as we do in Java  2  Delegates When I use delegated properties in a Kotlin class  the properties that I retrieve have the suffix  This is a bit contrary to the fields that we get in Java  I do understand Kotlin does not have fields  only properties   How does this affect meta programming  However  with delegates I see that most of the methods retain their behavior as they do in Java  Are there any other differences that I have to be aware of  Making Java and Kotlin interoperable for me would require understanding about 1 discussed above  plus other limitations   differences that Kotlin brings to meta programming 
Is there an official Kotlin style guide  I m just getting into programming Kotlin and whenever I learn a new language I try to program the recommended way from the start  Sun s Java style guide  PEP8 for Python  etc   Is there something like this for Kotlin  I can t seem to find anything online that says one way or another

Kotlin  best practice for parallel nullable   null safe trait or interface  Consider the following simple trait  Now assume that I have a person class like so  If I build a library and I want to cater for both nullable and null safe users  I ll end up with duplicates like these  Is there a better way to achieve this  i e a trait or library function that can handle both cases without duplicating everything 
Are nullable operators valid within generic class  Kotlin has pretty features   and   handling nullable types  But this one just stroke me    what if you don t know if you are dealing with nullable or non nullable type  What if you have generics class   then you just have some type and that s it  Does Kotlin allow to have  nullable  operators applied to generic type   here   does the type can be made nullable inside class  like   and what if the class will be instantiated with nullable type    like   Will it cause nullable of nullable  like pointer to pointer in C++      type within type 
What is the place in type hierarchy of nullable types  You can inherit type from type   but whenever you define type you will get type  nullable on  for free  But where does it lie exactly in type hierarchy  inherits from or other way around  I ask this because I am puzzled with such code  I don t understand why line     is compiled  Or in other words I don t understand nullable types hierarchy then  because until now I though of as or any type derived from it  Can you derive non nullable type from nullable one and what it would mean then  Sorry if this is something obvious  I am just learning Kotlin      for nullable types it should be

Accessing Kotlin extension functions from Java Is it possible to access extension functions from Java code  I defined the extension function in a Kotlin file  Where is a  generated  java class  Now  I wanted to access it in my normal java code  However  that doesn t work  The IDE won t recognize the method and compilation fails  What does work is using with a static function from kotlin  by using so my IDE seems to be configured correctly  I searched through the whole Java interop file from the kotlin docs and also googled a lot  but I couldn t find it  What am I doing wrong  Is this even possible 
Kotlin  Superclass is not accessible from trait In Kotlin  given some class  And a trait T that requires subclasses to extend A   One would expect to be able to call or the more explicit   since all the type information is there   but instead it yields   Question   How  can I override some method from within the trait  Notes  Of course  without overriding I could just do  But I do want my trait to be able to  intercept   be in the middle   I had to use some delegate in order to achieve a similar behavior  but I d like to know if it s possible to do this using traits 
AOP with Kotlin I used AOP a lot with Java  It looks like that traditional java approaches can easily be reused with Kotlin  Given Kotlin emphasis on immutability JDK proxies seem to be the most feasible solution in Kotlin provided that you re following the same interface first  better say trait first in Kotlin  programming style  e g   So now one can easily write an aspect in  say  Spring AOP and apply it to the instances of MyServiceImpl  It should be mentioned that Java interface based generated proxies may be more favored by Kotlin developers as cglib requires to get rid of final  i e  resort to open classes in Kotlin  and use parameterless public constructors for every class which should be wrapped by AOP proxies  At the same time Java interface based generated proxies unfortunately impose significant performance penalty so I m wondering if AOP programming can be done more intuitively or natively to Kotlin in some cases  So  consider the following example  when I want to use AOP for  Logging arguments and return result of each method exposed from a service  Starting transaction before function call and closing it after function call completes  commit rollback depending on whether or not an exception has been thrown while making a particular service call   The most effective but unfortunately the most verbose brute force solution in the aforementioned example with MyService MyServiceImpl might look as follows  The LoC complexity of that approach is O N K  where N is a number of method and K is a number of aspects that I want to apply  So what I m looking is a possible effective  both in terms of performance and LoC  solution for aspects in Kotlin preferrably without resorting to cglib generated proxies as they impose too many limitations like saying goodbye to final classes and not having parameterless public constructors

How do I make IntelliJ respect Maven Kotlin plugin output directory  I am writing Kotlin and compiling to JavaScript  I also have some HTML CSS resources  I have a Maven project setup that copies my HTML resources to the build directory and the has its location set to be a subdirectory of the output directory     When building with maven this behaves exactly as expected and my output directory contains my compiled JavaScript file in the folder and my HTML CSS files in the appropriate places  When I import the project into IntelliJ however  it doesn t respect the location set in the pom xml and instead drops my generated JavScript file into   I can fix this after import by going into and changing it to but I would like to be able to setup the pom xml in such a way that this step is unnecessary  On a related note  why does setting the output path not result in my HTML CSS files getting dropped into   It would seem that the output path isn t being respected by the copy  Edit  Here is the pom xml excert 
How do I do post compile bundling in Maven  I have a maven project that contains some Kotlin source files and some web resources  HTML CSS   During the compile phase  the Kotlin source is compiled to JavaScript and ends up in the build output location  along with some other folders that I am not familiar with  I would like a build step that occurs after the compile is finished that will copy my resources and compiled output and dependencies  kotlin js  into a folder with the correct hierarchy that I deploy or debug  I know how to copy the resources into the build output folder  but the build output folder appears to have some other files in it that are auto generated by maven which I do not want to deploy  Ideally  I would also like the clean phase to delete this destination directory

How do I test Kotlin code when compiling to JavaScript  I have a Kotlin JavaScript project in IntelliJ  Ultimate   I want to be able to write tests for this project  I have tried a number of different things ranging from writing tests with Spek  this would be ideal  to writing them in Karma Jasmine  The problem with Spek is that I could not get it to work with a JavaScript project  It complains about some jars not being a JavaScript library  The problem with Karma Jasmine is that I couldn t figure out how to get the test runner to pick up the tests from my Kotlin test output  When the tests are written in plain JavaScript  they can t access my Kotlin objects because I don t know how to reference them correctly with all of the name mangling that occurs when you do Kotlin to JavaScript compilation  I m open to anything at the moment  since this is an Angular project  I can probably figure out how to do end to end testing with Protractor  though I would really prefer some unit test coverage 
Generic casting in Kotlin I have the following classes and interfaces  And this analogous  I think   Kotlin code  Note  MyActivityComponent implementation is always in Java so that Dagger can process it  The  problem  is that MyActivity getComponent   in Kotlin requires a cast to the return type even though subclasses   My understanding of Kotlin s generics is admittedly weak  and I m having trouble translating from Java s generics  Can someone explain why this cast is necessary or  preferably  the correct implementation which removes the need for casting  I ve also tried things like  and With the same result  casting required  
Kotlin data class copy function not working Maybe I m misinterpreting how the function of a class works or maybe there s a bug  but the following is example of the function not working as expected  Kotlin  Java It seems that is just making a new instance of and not copying the values  If I put the variables in the constructor  the values are assigned  but then it s no different than constructing a new instance

Kotlin  why do constructor parameters have  internal  visibility by default  If we have a class  Its contructor parameter is accessible through  because it s also a property   If we want to restrict access to this property we should declare it as   Since in many cases from Java world  and if a class is not intended to be data class  fields which are assigned from constructor parameters are for private   protected use it feels like an additional effort to explicitely declare them in Kotlin  Also  Kotlin classes are final by default  so why not follow this principle for properties  Am I missing something

Is there a way to have a private file constant in Kotlin Suppose I have some Utils kt file which will contain only some utility functions  no classes  no objects  And suppose that those functions use some common set of constant values  So I do something like this  Unfortunately Kotlin treats private as  available to the whole package   So CONST1 and CONST2 are available to all files which are in the same package  The only way to isolate them is to move this file to a separate package  But what if I have several utility files like this  each with its own set of private constants  Then i have only two options  move each of them to a unique package or give up and have consts from all of them accessible everywhere  Either way seems to create clutter  Any options or advice   upd  actually  I must say this is one of those rare things that bother me in Kotlin   no way to make some entity be file local  without using some syntax hacks   it s either available to whole package or to everyone at all

Confusion with Kotlin generics I m new to Kotlin and I m trying to write code which does something fairly simple  however I cannot figure out how to use generics to get it to work  I have a trait which represents a handler for things  I cannot change the code for a Handler as it comes from a library  All of the code below is in my control   is an open class that has subclasses such as and etc  A trait called does something to create a List of AdminUsers and then passes the list to a handler for   Now I want to pass an a handler for instead of   Let s say the handler simply logs the names of the users  and doesn t do anything with Admin specific properties  However  this code gives me a TypeMismatch  Since the Handler is of the type and is immutable  the preceding code should be completely safe  however the compiler isn t able to figure it out  If I had access to the code for Handler I could do the following and it would work   However  as I said before  I cannot modify Handler as it comes from a library  Also  it seems hacky to have to do this because the type of Handler is fully general and should be usable for other kinds of handlers too  I tried subclassing Handler and using that   However now I get an error that says  Parameter T is declared as  in  but occurs in  invariant  position in Handler>  I tried   But that gives me more errors  Why is this so confusing  And how can I use generics to get the preceding code to work  Edit  I can make it work by writing a generic function that converts a into   And then   But  this seems so wasteful  Especially look at the body of the conversion function   It is doing nothing  Yet I have to go through the rigamarole of using it everytime just to satisfy the types  Is there a better way  Is it technically possible to make the Kotlin compiler smarter so that this type jugglery is not needed

What are the limits on dynamic double dispatch in Kotlin  I m just starting to explore Kotlin  and I m curious about how far it moves beyond Java s core dynamic binding dispatch semantics  Let s say I write code that looks something like this  Based on the above code  what can I expect to happen  Do I get a failure at runtime because Horse doesn t implement add Animal   Can it accurately differentiate them in calls of the above nature  where the compile time type of the values being compared was Animal  at least  as written  but their runtime types were more specific  Does it change anything if we used var instead of val  Thanks in advance  EDIT  Modified core code  I see the problem the first responder highlighted  I wasn t thinking straight  Clearly I haven t actually compiled this  I m still kind of exploring at a conceptual level  Also  I will give it a shot in the actual compiler  but I m concerned that there will be situations in which it works and others in which it doesn t based on some criteria that I don t fully understand  I wasn t able to find reference docs on how dynamic dispatch is implemented in Kotlin  not sure about it for Java either  for that matter  I wrote something a few months ago that I thought would work based on JVM docs  but it didn t  and I never had a chance to explore exactly why   Anyhow thanks again

Kotlin let analogue which returns the receiver I was wondering if there s a standard function which behaves similarly to but returns the receiver itself  not the value calculated by   My piece of code with   So  if there would be such a function named  for example    the code above would shorten a little and become more expressive  Of course  I might write this function by myself and include it into every project  but I suppose  people would like a function with such semantics  Or is there another nice way of doing the same in Kotlin 
 When  statement vs Java  switch  statement Pattern matching in Kotlin is nice and the fact it does not execute next pattern match is good in 90  of use cases  In Android  when database is updated  we use Java switch property to go on next case if we do not put a break to have code looking like that  So if someone has an app with version 1 of the DB and missed the app version with DB v2  he will get all the needed upgrade code executed  Converted to Kotlin  we get a mess like  Here we have only 3 version  imagine when DB reaches version 19    Anyway to makes when acting in the same way than switch  I tried continue without luck

Access property delegate in Kotlin Kotlin has delegated properties which is a very nice feature  But sometimes and methods are not enough  Let s say I want to create a object lazily and to close it later  Here s an example of how such delegate property could be implemented  And that s how I would like to use it  Unfortunately  this approach doesn t work because it seems that Kotlin doesn t allow to access property delegates directly  Is there any way to do what I want  Or are there any plans to add such functionality to Kotlin because it would be such a neat feature 
Partial class delegation in Kotlin How do I partial delegate methods fields in Kotlin  To be specific  here I am trying to inherit class from interface and implement field in the wrapper   That would clean up the implementation  because is just a state field  Note that can t be a class because I want to use several such interfaces  The alternative is to implement all in one place  Is there a way pattern that would solve that problem with easy and as little code as possible  Code bytecode generation is not an option for me  UPDATE I was not very clear about that  but please note that is unique for every   So I may suggest a  half bad  solution with run time assertions  The question is still open  since a really good solution would check that at compilation time

Does  internal  visibility modifier in Kotlin work yet  Assuming a module in Kotlin means a project  though it would be good to see what the exact definition of a Kotlin module means    unclear from docs      Do Kotlin visibility modifiers work yet  I have two projects  a main project and a test project  with different  non overlapping  package paths  The test project is dependent on the main project  in Eclipse   It does not seem to matter whether the interfaces or classes in the main project are marked or not  In the test project the main project interfaces classes are visibile accessible not matter what  The only difference shows up if you mark the main project ones and then there is a visibility issues  But with or without it doesn t seem to make any difference  From what I can make out from the docs  omitting a visibility modifier on an interface or class effects the default visibility  i e   
Kotlin companion objects and reflection Ran into something interesting when using companion objects and Java reflection  I m not sure if its intended or not  or if I m just not understanding things fully  I have this code The field eventually gets filled via reflection from another class  What I ve found is that if I access the class with   I get the internal companion class which only has methods for accessing that field  Accessing it via gets me the expected Java class with full access to the fields  Am I just missing something obvious  Is there a reason for this behavior

Kotlin  Initialize class attribute in constructor I create a Kotlin class with a class attribute  which I want to initialize in the constructor  Unfortunately I have to declare the attribute as Nullable with the     sign  although the attribute will be initialized in the constructor  Declaring this attribute as Nullable attribute makes it always necessary to force an NonNull value with      or to provide a Null check with      Is there any way to avoid this  if the class attribute will be initialized in the constructor  I would like to appreciate a solution like this one 
Kotlin for game dev Background  I m always searching for a language to replace Java for game development  Kotlin looks promising with a good IDE support and Java interop  But one of the FPS killers for a game  on Android especially  is GC usage  So  some libraries  like libgdx  are using pools of objects  custom collections and other tricks to avoid frequent GC run  For Java that can be done in a clear way  Some other JVM languages espesially with functional support using a lot of GC by it s nature  so it is hard to avoid  Questions  Does Kotlin creates any invisible GC overhead in comparison to Java  Which features of Kotlin is better to avoid to have less GC work

How to replace a FrameLayout with a fragment with Kotlin on Android I m trying to develop an Android app with Kotlin  but I ve hit a bit of a snag when trying to dynamically move fragments around  What I m trying to do is replace a FrameLayout in an Activity s layout with a fragment  Currently whenever I try to run my app it just shows a white screen under the toolbar leading me to believe that the fragment is not being added to the FrameLayout the way I expected  Here is my main Activity where I do the first transaction  Here is the fragment I m attempting to create  It simply inflates a view while adding a callback for when a button is pressed  Here s the layout that the main Activity uses with setContentView  And lastly here s the layout that the fragment is inflating  < xml version= 1 0  encoding= utf 8  ><LinearLayout xmlns android=     android layout width= match parent     android layout height= match parent     android orientation= vertical  >    <EditText        android id=  
Kotlin  unit test assert object after gson I have JUnit test like that  service is Retrofit  that uses GsonConverter to deserialize json into instances  Test is passing  even if ACategory filled with id = null  title = null etc  So  as far as i know  gson using reflection  and kotlin lazily resolves this nullability constraints on first access  Is there any way to force this resolve  Some good looking solution without direct access to fields manually  I really don t want to write every assert by hand

Kotlin Android extensions and retained fragment I am using Kotlin Android extensions in my project and I came across some behavior that I am unable to understand  I use this code to retain my fragment in the activity  This is the retained   and its XML layout hello xml  Everything works as expected   the displays Hello world  on screen on the first launch  But when you rotate the screen the does not work  This is weird because is not nullable and has to reffer to some view  If you remove and leave the fragment recreate every time this problem disappears  Any thoughts what might cause this problem 
How can I get the name of a Kotlin property  I have the following function to access a property s delegate  It uses Kotlin reflection to get a property s name and Java reflection to get the field  The method is used like this  However  I would prefer to use it like this  The problem with the code above is getting the property name of and getting the instance from   From what I know about Kotlin  this is probably not possible  however I d like to see if I can clean up my function at all  To give a bigger picture of what I m trying do here s my complete code  I want an observable delegate to which I can add and remove observers using the delegate reference and without creating addition variables  Edit  I just realized that the function also isn t strict because the property delegate field name is referenced by name  which doesn t require a strong reference to the enclosing class  Here s an example to demonstrate the problem  This compiles and runs without error because and both result in a field string of  
Invoking Java function with vararg not compiling in Kotlin I m trying to call a Java method from Kotlin but the compiler doesn t manage to find the proper signature  The method has 2 signatures   Then in kotlin I just want to call this  which seems completely valid to me   But the compiler say I read Kotlin and Java method with vararg have some interrop issues  is there a way to fix that without using a java class as a bridge  
Kotlin Annotation Processing  is it possible to generate an extension method  I m playing around with Kotlin and I think that it would be great to have  functional classes   see the example of what I want  The idea is that I would be able to use it like  If I were to write which I want by myself  the resulting class would be  But it s tedious a bit to write this by hands in every  functional class   So here s my question  is it possible to make an annotation and then process it adding method with the desired code  I know that kapt can be used for Kotlin annotation processing  but AFAIK for now it cannot generate Kotlin code and there s no way to make an extension function in Java generated code  Is there any way to generate a new Kotlin method for a class  Node  I understand that the idea of functional classes has few use cases and that it s not that hard to add the mentioned method manually  but for me it s academical interest to the concept of annotation processing in Kotlin  UPD  Just my thought about functional classes  there s language feature of delegating interfaces and it would work good here  but reference is not visible in that block  Example

Kotlin uses runtime assertions for null checking   Performance overhead  I m considering Kotlin for a simulation framework and noticed that the compiler interweaves static checkParameterIsNotNull calls after for each method which can be accessed from java  This checks wether the method parameter is not null by accessing  and dumping   the call stack every time this method is run  Now that in a typical simulation framework the count of runs might be in the millions  I m wondering about the performance impact of such a feature  If there an option to turn it off

Can we access the PropertyMetaData of any property in kotlin  Is there a way in kotlin to access the from outside of a property  To be more specific  from the delegation  Looking for something like this  EDIT  a more suitable example now  EDIT  after 1 0 0 beta 1038  This code snippet worked like a charm before  note  the String  scrollPlace  was not passed explicitly when using the previous version of kotlin since the property name was passed  implicitly  before   In this example I m using some chaining  The extension function injectBy  which is based on the pattern suggested under 1  of the accepted answer  except for passing a custom string   creates a O2dInjectionClosure  ReadOnlyProperty  instance  The solution 1  would work of course  even though it s not as convenient as with the use of propertyDelgated  but the chaining causes some trouble  At least a proper solution haven t come to my mind yet  The extension function replaceBy creates another new O2dInjectionClosure instance  Thus  I somehow would like to do the necessary stuff on the last call of the chaining  but in a convenient way     I hope it s somehow reasonable

How to create caching hot version of rx Single  The RxJava v1 0 13 introduced new type of an Observable  rx Single  It fits great the request response model but lacks the standard side effects introducing operators like doOnNext    So  it s much harder to make multiple things happen as a result  My idea was to replace doOnNext   with multiple subscriptions to the same Single instance  But this can cause the underlaying work to be done multiple times  once per every subscription  Example rx Single implementation  Usage  Is it possible to create a instance of Single that will not fetchSomeData   multiple times even when single subscribe   is called multiple times  but cache and return the same result

Writing Apps for Android with Swift First of all I m focused on iOS but but I ve done ~2 apps for android in Java and it was horrible  I can t explain it why  Was it Java or Android itself but I hate it so much that when now I have to write another app for Android so I m looking every option for me  This is what I found  Kotlin   people said this is  Swift for android  but I still stuck with Android libraries  Silver    you can use Swift to write code directly against the  NET  Java  Android and Cocoa APIs  And you can also share a lot of non UI code between platforms   But at this moment I ve trouble with download it  What s your opinion in this matter  Do you have any experience with those two solutions 
Kotlin accessing constant in inner class from Java NOTE  This issue has been resolved since Kotlin 1 0 beta version  at least   Keeping the rest of the contents intact for historical reason  I m using Kotlin with Android and I m trying to use some constants from the SDK  like this one  It doesn t see AudioSource  so it doesn t see the MIC as well  I ve tried changing the imports  cleaning the project  Nothing worked so far  I ve temporarily solved it by importing it in a Java class  which worked just fine  and then I just refer to my Java class from my Kotlin file but I would really like to know why this happens and how I can avoid having that Java class 
Kotlin overload resolution ambiguity in the standard library In Kotlin 0 12 1230 it appears that deprecated APIs are blocking the use of their replacements  For example  the compiler complains about the following snippet because it  cannot choose among    candidates without completing type inference  The candidates are and both of which have identical signatures and extends   Furthermore  is deprecated in favor of   Attempting to resolve the type inference ambiguity  like you see below  results in the compiler complaining about  overload resolution ambiguity   Is there any way to resolve the ambiguity while we wait for deprecated APIs to disappear entirely  It seems that casting to the least specific type  in this case the deprecated type   accomplishes it  but now my code explicitly depends on a deprecated type when I have no desire to do so  Hopefully there is a better way

Kotlin with JPA  default constructor hell As JPA requires  classes should have a default  non arg  constructor to instantiate the objects when retrieving them from the database  In Kotlin  properties are very convenient to declare within the primary constructor  as in the following example  But when the non arg constructor is declared as a secondary one it requires values for the primary constructor to be passed  so some valid values are needed for them  like here  In case when the properties have some more complex type than just and and they re non nullable  it looks totally bad to provide the values for them  especially when there s much code in primary constructor and blocks and when the parameters are actively used    when they re to be reassigned through reflection most of the code is going to be executed again  Moreover   properties cannot be reassigned after the constructor executes  so immutability is also lost  So the question is  how can Kotlin code be adapted to work with JPA without code duplication  choosing  magic  initial values and loss of immutability  P S  Is it true that Hibernate aside of JPA can construct objects with no default constructor 
How to mimic or achieve IS A relationships for Kotlin data classes I have been exploring Kotlin and have written a small program script that does a task I find boring  In the development of the program I use data classes to represent a Playlist  at one point in the design I wanted to have a special type of that was   I couldn t get this to work  How would you achieve this relationship with Kotlin  In Java  I would just extend  or perhaps create an interface abstract class for them both to inherit from   I just wanted to be able to have a rather than In the end I just created a object  but I am interested in if it is possible to create IS A hierarchies with data classes 
Adding a  provided  configuration to a kotlin java library using gradle I have a java library to which I ve added a  provided  configuration using gradle  Everything works as expected with this setup  Now I want to start using kotlin in my library  so I modified the build script to look like this  sans pluses  Without even adding any kotlin files  and even if I do   the library no longer compiles saying that it can t find the classes in the provided library  android in my case   What do I need to change to get it so that the provided dependencies are recognized again 
RxJava  onBackpressureBlock   strange behavior I am playing around with RxJava  RxKotlin to be precise   Here I have the following s  And I d like to have a few of them merged and running concurrently  They ignore backpressure so the backpressure operators have to be applied to them  Then I create And then I merge the s  The first one is supposed to emit items incessantly  If I do so in the last 3 seconds of the run I get the following output  Seems that the s are subscribed on the same one thread  and the first observable is blocked for 3+ seconds  But when I swap and calls the output becomes what I expected  the output gets merged during the whole execution  It s obvious to me that calls order matters in RxJava  but I don t quite understand what happens in this particular situation  So what happens when operator is applied before and what if after

Does Kotlin have an identity function  Scala has a generic function in the Predef  Does Kotlin have a similar facility in the standard library  Of course I could simply use instead  but I find easier to read  and instantiating all those lambdas is a little wasteful  I must be able to use this function in places where a function is expected  for any type   Is such a function even possible in Kotlin s type system   In the case of Scala  there is an implicit conversion that wraps the method inside a function object or something  
Spring constructor annotations on Kotlin data class with default values To use spring persistence but maintain immutable types I ve added the PersistenceConstructor annotation to my data classes  This tells spring to use that constructor when loading classes from the database  However  I m having trouble getting spring to find the constructor  This works 100  of the time on my machine but when deployed to heroku it consistently fails  It looks like  by having default values for parameters kotlin generates more than one constructors but the problem is that each constructor get the annotation applied to them so it s just luck  or jdk implementation specific  which one spring picks up  The default one has no names for the parameters so Spring doesn t know what to do with it  My real constructors are larger than this so it would be a pain to not have default values  Is there a way to get the annotation to only apply to the constructor without default values 
`break` and `continue` in `forEach` in Kotlin Kotlin has very nice iterating functions  like or   but I am not able to make the and operators work with them  both local and non local   The goal is to mimic usual loops with the functional syntax as close as it might be  It was definitely possible in some older versions of Kotlin  but I struggle to reproduce the syntax  The problem might be a bug with labels  M12   but I think that the first example should work anyway  It seems to me that I ve read somewhere about a special trick annotation  but I could not find any reference on the subject  Might look like the following 
Function declaration error when compiling with Kotlin 12 I ve inherited an older Kotlin codebase  and attempting to compile with the newest compiler had many issues  The one that I m having trouble figuring out are these strange functions that are hanging out in the middle of a class  without any apparent call  I m wondering if anyone knows what this used to be  and what it was replaced with in newer versions of Kotlin  Specifically  the lines in question are the and   both in between braces just hanging out 
Idiomatic way to spilt sequence into three lists using Kotlin So this is possibly more about functional programming than Kotlin  I am at that stage were a little knowledge is dangerous  and I wrote the app in Kotlin so seems fair to ask a Kotlin question as its Kotlins structures that i am interested in  I have a sequence of items  they are in batches of three  so the stream may look like What I want to do is to spilt this into three lists  currently I am doing this by partitioning into two lists  one that contains the numbers and one that contains everything else  then taking the second half of the result  the letters and symbols and partitioning again  into letters and symbols  thus i end up with three lists  This strikes me as somewhat inefficient  maybe a functional approach isn t the best approach here  Is there an efficient way of doing this  are my choices  this or a for loop  Thanks

Error  Execution failed for task   app clean   Unable to delete file I m trying to rebuild my Android Studio Gradle project  containing mostly Kotlin code   but it started to throw an during the cleaning rebuilding process  This started happening after I tried to change my project s package structure  Unfortunately  I did it by renaming and moving the source folders rather than refactoring through Android Studio  which was a bad idea  I ve been searching for a solution to this problem all day  and these are the things I have tried to no avail  Doing a Gradle sync  Reinstalling Java JRE and Java SDK  Reinstalling the latest version of Android Studio  1 4   Rolling back to the previous AS version  1 3   Invalidating the AS cache and restarting  Deleting the and directories in the project directory  Deleting the directory in my user directory  Running from the AS terminal  Manually copying the sources over to a new project  weird that it somehow persists across projects     Things that I ve tried with a little success  but only let me perform one more clean and rebuild before the error occurs again  Closing AS  manually deleting the build files and opening it again  Killing the process while AS is running  this could technically be done every time  but it s tedious and slows down the build process  So it seems that compile the Java process may put a lock on the build files for some reason  but it might also be something to do with Kotlin  I have a  more mature  Java Android project that I m working on  though I can t reproduce this error when cleaning it  It seems to only happen to my Kotlin project  Any ideas  Thanks in advance  Update  I ve found that the problem is being caused by the Kotlin Android plugin  The problem disappears when I remove from the module s file and comes back when I reinsert it  Feel free to offer any insight into this  Update 2  The last update isn t the cause  I found that if a project contains a Kotlin file then rebuilding and cleaning fails  It continues to fail  even if all the Kotlin files are removed  until the background Java process is killed  meaning it has some kind of lock on the build files  I submitted a bug here with more details and steps to reproduce the bug  KT 9440

Kotlin Map  why is there no toHashMap    In Kotlin  class has and extension methods  But why is there no method  In fact  the resulting implementation of many stdlib methods is   but casting it to in my code would make me rely on the implementation which is bad  Introducing such a method would keep developers safe from digging into the implementation  and with the current implementation it would just perform the cast  My use case is  When I use it leads to overhead of creating a new map  which I d be happy to avoid  So  is it by design

How to create re usable library I want to create a kotlin library that can be re used across my android apps  However I don t want it to be an android library since I was hoping to hook it up to some testing and mocking frameworks  In my android app  I right clicked on the top level app node and did new  > Module and then selected  Java Library   However in the new java library it seems like Kotlin is only partially being supported  Syntax for the most part works but other things don t  For instance  forEach on my hash map is unresolved as well as attempting to index it such as items 0   Am I going about this the right way 
What are the Kotlin class initialisation semantics  I haven t been able to find anything in the language definition that explains the initialisation of a class in Kotlin  The results of running this program change depending whether the property is initialised at  1  or at  2   I m surprised that the declaration order is relevant in the language and would like to understand the decisions behind this  My expectation would be that properties are initialised before the constructor body is invoked 
Create an annotation instance in Kotlin I have a framework written in Java that  using reflection  get the fields on an annotation and make some decisions based on them  At some point I am also able to create an ad hoc instance of the annotation and set the fields myself  This part looks something like this  Now I am trying to do the exact thing in Kotlin  Bear in mind that the annotation is in a third party jar  Anyway  here is how I tried it in Kotlin  But the compiler complains about  Annotation class cannot be instantiated So the question is  how should I do this in Kotlin

Why Kotlin compiler requires the explicit initializer of var property  I can t understand the following piece of Kotlin documentation  The only explanation of why the compiler requires explicit initializer here  at least the only explanation I can come up with  is that Kotlin does not have default values of properties  Is it right  If so  why  In other words  what is the difference between Kotlin properties and Java fields  which have default values  which doesn t allow us to have default values of properties

Unexpected type difference between equivalent Java and Kotlin Stream code EDIT March 1 2016  Fair warning  this question was asked about Kotlin before 1 0 0  Things are different since Kotlin 1 0 0  See  Jayson Minard s writing below for a Kotlin 1 0 0 answer  In Java 8 code that uses Stream  I write things like But in similar code written in Kotlin  I get unexpected results  Why would the return value of the expression be of a different list type in the Kotlin code than in the Java code   I m guessing it is because of some Java Collections specific magic in Kotlin

How to instantiate a Kotlin generic In Kotlin  how do one instantiate a generic  In C  and Java this task is very simple and I feel really stupid for not being able to do this in any way I have tried  Note that I have no control over the derivation of the  underlying  Kotlin generic and hence cannot use variance  that which I can however guarantee is that it is an instantiable Kotlin class  not Java  which does have a zero argument constructor  Also note that I have read this already  without getting it to work    A bit of opinion   really really like Kotlin after a week or two s play  C  Code   a very simple example  Java is very similar 
Does kotlin support making a class implementing an interface outside of its definition file  I see kotlin List and kotlin MutableList is implemented by java util ArrayList  But where did kotlin put this trick  Compiler or somewhere in stdlib  If kotlin supports making a class implementing an interface outside of its definition file like the ArrayList case  it will be fascinated

Kotlin  Single instance of a non singleton class  I was doing some experiments with Kotlin and I was playing with singleton patterns  I wanted to persist a single instance of a object  Just like in Java  I thought I d wrap a singleton around it  What surprised me however is there seems to be no built in way to compile getters for it  like properties for a class   It was just straight up exposing that property to the world without any encapsulation  which I did not want  I could just make it private and explicitly make my own getter  but I m looking at Kotlin because I m passionate about being lazy   However  I think I stumbled on another way to do this  I could create a Kotlin file and declare a private variable and a public function to encapsulate and expose it safely  without putting it in any class or singleton at all  The thing is it just feels way too easy  I feel like I m doing something bad  But at the same time this makes sense  Nobody likes calling a hundred times  Is this pattern I discovered valid and not an anti pattern  Also  is there any way to compile getters and encapsulate final properties on the singleton  Or do I implement those methods myself 
Can I add operators to existing classes  In Kotlin  I would like to add an method to an existing class that hasn t got an implementation yet  In my case I would like to compare two instances   and thus   should return for two arrays and if they are of the same size and if all items are equal  Thus for all   The documentation states that operators can be defined by extension methods  doesn t provide an method  So I wrote  However this extension gets ignored  When I compare two s such as it doesn t call the extension method and thus always evaluates to for two different instances 
Is it considered idiomatic to always prefer properties over backing fields  I recently converted an Android project from Java to Kotlin using Android Studio s Kotlin plugin  Post conversion  many fields in my classes were highlighted  and hovering over them displays the message Should I infer from the existence of this message warning that it is always considered more idiomatic  in Kotlin  to use properties with explicitly defined getters and or setters  Or is the IDE being a little over zealous with the informational messages  Answers that include references to official sources preferred

Kotlin smartcasting approximates due to nulls in using the when I would like to share some knowledge that I have found regarding Kotlin when expression  the Kotlin documentation  even though written as simple and forthcoming as I can imagine it written  does ask for a very holistic understanding  Two things that was not immediately clear were  How would the when statement match multiple instances that are nullable  How do you match based on a function call  Without getting verbose  I will simply give you the code and its results  The findings are commented in the code  There were definitely a few  in hindsight  obvious things that I missed on first take for the when statement   but there are a few eye openers as well

Protected members not accessible in extension functions  Kotlin features a couple of visibility modifiers as well as extension functions  The documentation states that   But what does this mean for the visibility of class members within extension functions  Let s consider the following contrived example  The code will not compile  It seems that protected members are not accessible when extending the class  So does resolved statically mean the extension function is syntactic sugar for having something like this in Java  This would explain why protected members aren t accessible  On the other hand it s possible to use  and even omit  in extension functions  So what is the exact scope of extension functions

Kotlin   Interface with immutable property implemented by class with mutable I have the following code  Works around a limitation in Spring where  ConfigurationProperties classes need to follow the JavaBeans convention with mutable properties  Instead of inject the mutable TokenConfigurationConfig we inject the interface  It works ok  but just wondering  Is it possible in Kotlin to define an interface with an immutable property  that is implemented by class with a mutable property  Uses of the interface would see the property as immutable  while users of the class would see it as mutable

Use of Parceler with Kotlin data class with constructor for serialization Is there a way to use Parceler with Kotlin data classes and constructor for serialization without using annotation for each field  If I try and use library like this  I get   But if I add it works just fine  Why is that  Update  There are other another way to use this library  I could just remove annotation  but then I will get error I think  haven t tested it  I also could make all constructor parameters optional and add but that has a side effect that I have to check all properties of the class if they are null or not  Update 2  This is what worked for me  In short generated Java class must have default empty constructor  One way to achieve that is to do as above   all variables should have default values

Kotlin  Inner scope   This I just made use of Kotlins auto refactor and it basically left me with this  Which does not work  IntelliJ shows me that refers to the outer class but not to the OnPreDrawListener  Why is that  The kotlin docs say that this always refer to the inner most scope 
Kotlin  Create and refer true Java arrays  for JNA  I am trying to use JNA with Kotlin and I ve ran into a problem  My direct mapped object  The issue seems to lay in the way I m calling it  JNA doesn t like Kotlin s class I m assuming because it doesn t know how to map such  Is there a way to refer to real Java arrays so that JNA can map this function  Also  is there a way to construct such  This is the way I m calling it 
How to delegate implementation to a property in Kotlin  Kotlin enables me to implement an interface by delegating to a primary constructor argument like so  But this exhibits the backing implementer to the user  Delegating to an anonymous also seems to be ok  This hides the implementation details  but we loose access to features not provided by the interface  which in this case is mutability  I would therefore like to delegate the implementation to a property that is not in the primary constructor  What I would like to have is similar to which doesn t compile  Is it possible to have a property defined explicitly in the class body and still be able to delegate implementation to it 
Kotlin   running an integration test  error `fun main is already defined` I have written an integration test for a Web application but I don t know how to run this test  Maven build fails with the following error when I execute Here is my main class  Application kt  Here is a part of my test class There is no such error when I execute   So I suppose Kotlin is frightened of previously compiled classes  Though I am very unsure    What is the right way to run an integration test 
Why does this type need explicit cast  I ve created an extension function to JavaFX TableColumn that makes it more concise to implement a cellFactory without the repetetive boilerplate  The extension function is defined like this  To format a TableCell I only need to define what should happen in TableCell updateItem when there is a non null item available for the current cell  To format a LocalDateTime for example  I can now write  I then went on to define another extension that does just this  so I can just write  This function uses the first function  like this  My question is why I have to cast the LocalDateTime to TemporalAccessor  My first attempt was  The compiler complains  Granted  the DateTimeFormatter format function takes a TemporalAccessor  not a LocalDateTime  but LocalDateTime does indeed implement TemporalAccessor  via Temporal   The cast to TemporalAccessor is only needed in the formatAsDateTime extension function  not when using cellFormat directly from the call site  Shouldn t Kotlin be able to perform this smart cast automatically 
Anko  inner scope of apply  confusing property resolution I m writing an Android layout using Anko DSL  When defining a   I wanted to make it center aligned  so I wrote this  But the alignment didn t change  In debugger I saw that gravity is set for the which is the  s parent  Changing the statement to either and and even solves the problem  thus in the original code implicit is definitely resolved to   Why does this happen  Do I misunderstand something in Kotlin lambdas or is it a bug in Kotlin or Anko

Best way to combine integer flags using Kotlin  In java we regularly combine flags via the | operator  e g  I can t seem to find the equivalent operator in Kotlin  Anyone know a convenient way to combine integer flags in Kotlin 
Why doesn t smart cast handle this situation  I have some code with a similar structure to this  From my understanding  smart casting should infer that in the final  else  statement  neither a nor b can be null  yet it doesn t seem to infer this which results in an error  Is there a legitimate reason that smartcasting isn t working in the way I expect here  or is it just not as smart as I think it is 
Implement file Drag Drop with LWjGL I would like to ask how can i implement file drag and drop with LWjGL  I am not quite good with AWT so i tried to search for some code examples and found out that i need to create object and provide him a implementation  I also not sure what i should use as Component  I found method which gives us a Component but it s usually returns   I have no idea what to do with my DropTarget object after that My code  it doesn t seem to work because nothing is printed

Kotlin  UnsupportedOperationException for reified generic with get set operator I am trying to convert the functions and in my library to operator functions and   respectively  My functions use a reified generic type  they are also inline methods   You can see my library here   The compiler has no issue letting me pass and I don t see why using non operator functions the inference works just fine  yet using operators fails at runtime  The code is as follows  The interesting part is that I can do this with infix functions just fine  for example  I can also do this with other operators  for example both of these work  I also noticed that even works correctly  This is strange since it seems both and would have identical implementations  But if I add the following function to example  and then try the following call I run into the error

Kotlin multiplication between nullable and non nullable float errors even with null check I m porting a class called from Java which is filled with nullable types  It looks like this  These properties are nullable because they are read from JSON and might not exist  and since certain fields allow negative values is not a valid default  Certain properties need to be scaled if they exist so for that I m converting a previously static method to a Kotlin top level function  however I ve run into a bit of an issue  The precise message i get is this  image since Android Studio doesn t let me select and copy the message   I ve also tried to replicate this in the Kotlin playground with this piece of code  And this compiles and outputs 4 0 as expected  As far as I can see the two code samples are near identical  What exactly am I doing wrong and how can I fix this 
Kotlin type mistmatch     > SomeType vs SomeType I am working thru the Kotlin Koans and ran into this type mismatch  I know there are other solutions to the problem  but I would like to know what I am doing wrong  I the basic problem seems to be that I am generating a set of Products via a flatMap then I use this as the receiver for a fold the inferred type for is rather than Here is the actual function that I get the type mismatch on  it s not done  rather just syntax correct enough to show the type mismatch  Can someone explain why this does not work 
Maven configuration for using Dagger 2 in a mixed Java Kotlin project What is the recommended Maven setup for using Dagger 2 in a mixed Java Kotlin project  I found a sample project which uses Gradle   Something similar with Maven would be very helpful  UPDATE  What have I tried  I used the Kotlin configuration from kotlinlang org docs reference using maven html and the Dagger configuration from google github io dagger  I also used the build helper maven plugin plugin to integrate the annotation processing in IDEA  My main problem was that I run into compilation cycles  My configuration mixed the compilation of Kotlin and calling the annotation processor  which generates Dagger2 classes  I unsystematically tried to separate both phases but lacked the deeper Maven understanding to get it working

Kotlin using apply in companion object throws an unexpected error Let s say I d want to instantiate an object of class by copying values from class which is a common practice when  for example  mapping DTO s  To accomplish this in Java or Groovy I d create a static method on the appropriate DTO with the signature of and then copy values either with in Java or using in Groovy  In Kotlin I ve noticed that is very similar to Groovy s in that it allows me to directly access the object variables without constantly refering to the object itself since the reference seems to be implied within the closure  However I ve ran into a weird and unexpected error when using apply within companion objects  If I use inside a function of A s companion object I get an error Which is weird since I m calling apply directly on an instance of an object and would thus expect that I should always be able to access it s public properties  Not to mention that it seems like companion objects cannot be set to be thus the suggestion in the error message isn t all too helpful  Here s the full example code  What is going on here  What am I doing wrong

What s Kotlin s compatibility policy  Once Kotlin 1 0 is out  what will be the compatibility policy  As a user  I hope Kotlin would keep its compatibility  either in source or binary  Just as serious as Java  On contrast  Scala is a bad example  Failing to keep its binary compatibility between minor versions drove me away  And I believe a lot of users have left Scala partly because of its compatibility issue  This caused many libraries  including SBT at my time  cannot provide a complete suite of distributions for the whole series of Scala versions  This is just binary compatibility issue  Imagine if source compatibility was broken  I have decided to use Kotlin in my company s commercial project  So I really need to be sure Kotlin is serious about keeping compatibility  instead of pursuing beauty

Generics  Abstract class and type of child I have an abstract class called presenter  And I have implementations of these presenters  And view classes which call the bind method at a specified point  What I would like to archieve is to have a base class for classes like the which automatically call the bind method  It feels stupid to repeat these calls over and over again in all implementations  My approach is to have an abstract class which extends the which calls the bind method  But that obviously does not work as the bind class requires the implementation and not the abstract class 
Kotlin wildcard method I m having some problems using the retryWhen function by   When I create a function to be passed to in an   I cannot call function  It seems that Kotlin is expecting something that cannot be cast here  In this example  doesn t work  some another methods are available  but not this one   If I change the incoming parameters to   the keyword make it possible to use the function  But after I changed  the call shows an error  Did anyone knows how can I receive and produce the same type in kotlin  Be able to create the zipWith and return the expected value  Thanks

Fragment instance is retained but child fragment is not re attached Update  accepted answer points to explanation  bug  with a work around  but also see my Kotlin based work around attached as an answer below  This code is in Kotlin  but I think it is a basic android fragment life cycle issue  I have a Fragment that holds a reference to an other  subfragment  Here is basically what I am doing  I have a main fragment that has set to true I have a field in the main fragment that will hold a reference to the subfragment  initially this field is null In the main fragment s   I check to see if the subfragment field is null  if so  I create an instance of the subFragment and assign it to the field Finally I add the subfragment to a container in the layout of the main fragment  If the field is not null  ie we are in onCreateView due to a configuration change  I don t re create the subfragment  I just try to added it to the containter  When the device is rotated  I do observe the and methods of the subfragment being called  but I don t see any lifecyle methods being called on the subfragment during the process of adding the retained reference to the subfragment  to the child container when the main fragments view is re created  The net affect is that I don t see the subfragment view in the main fragment  If I comment out the if  subfragment == null  and just create a new subfragment everytime  i do see the subfragment in the view  Update The answer below does point out a bug  in which the childFragmentManager is not retained on configuration changes  This will ultimately break my intended usage  which was to preserve the backstack after rotation  however I think what I am seeing is something different  I added code to the activities method and I see something like this when the app is first launched  and then after rotation  here fm is the childFragmentManager  and as you can see  we still have the same instance of Tab1Fragment  but it has a new childFragmentManager  which I think is unwanted and due to the bug reported in the answer below  The thing is that I did add the subfragment to this new childFragmentManger  So it seems like the transaction never executes with the reference to the fragment that was retained  but does complete if I create a brand new fragment   I did try calling on the new childFragmentManager 
Consumer acting oddly in kotlin I m just getting back into Kotlin  transitioning from java  and I ve noticed that using a is trickier than it sounds  I m attempting to make a simple class for firing dead basic events  the only problem is according to IntelliJ the accept method does not exist  However  when I attempt to create a new consumer and use it straight away the accept method is there and works just as expected   Is there anything I may have missed or overlooked

Behavior with Kotlin Higher Order Functions and Single method interfaces  I was having some issues using RxJava and Kotlin earlier  I made some interesting discoveries which I m still puzzled about  There is the simple interface in RxJava I was trying to add an extension method to an   also an RxJava class  This would collect the emissions into a Google Guava using a to map the key off each item  When I tried to invoke this extension method I could not get it to compile  and it was not understanding the lambda expression at all  However  the strangest thing happened when I modified the extension method to use the function type  And then everything compiled fine  But this is what puzzled me  How come it did not infer the lambda onto the interface  When I use the standard method on the it infers the lambda just fine using the curly bracket syntax  But why does it not work for my extension method above

What is the Kotlin equivalent of Java Stream collect  If I want to collect my Kotlin collection into something that isn t built into the stdlib  how do I do it 
What Java 8 Stream collect equivalents are available in the standard Kotlin library  In Java 8  there is which allows aggregations on collections  In Kotlin  this does not exist in the same way  other than maybe as a collection of extension functions in the stdlib  But it isn t clear what the equivalences are for different use cases  For example  at the top of the JavaDoc for are examples written for Java 8  and when porting them to Kolin you can t use the Java 8 classes when on a different JDK version  so likely they should be written differently  In terms of resources online showing examples of Kotlin collections  they are typically trivial and don t really compare to the same use cases  What are good examples that really match the cases such as documented for Java 8   The list there is  Accumulate names into a List Accumulate names into a TreeSet Convert elements to strings and concatenate them  separated by commas Compute sum of salaries of employee Group employees by department Compute sum of salaries by department Partition students into passing and failing With details in the JavaDoc linked above  Note  this question is intentionally written and answered by the author  Self Answered Questions   so that the idiomatic answers to commonly asked Kotlin topics are present in SO  Also to clarify some really old answers written for alphas of Kotlin that are not accurate for current day Kotlin

Kotlin extension functions by type What is the idiomatic way to add a function to a class based on type  The following example uses List as the class  and the Type Parameter is the class of objects inside of the list  Lets say you want to sort each of these lists with a different comparator based on their type  This gives an error saying that both sort functions have the same signatures due to Java s overloading rules  In Java I might give them both different identifiable names but it is fairly ugly as Kotlin extensions  e g  a sortA   b sortB     Kotlin doesn t show sortA to a List< B > so there seems like there would be a better way of writing sort   to handle different comparators on different objects  The example is pretty simple but imagine if I don t have access to modify class A and B so I could not use inheritance or implement an interface on them  I also thought about adding a comparator to every class and use Any  But that seems cumbersome as well

Cannot call a function from init block because of val property I d like to initialize my class s properties  Because I m using heavily the functional elements of Kotlin  I d like to put these initializations to well named functions  to increase readability of my code  The problem is that I cannot assign a val property  if the code is not in the init block  but in function which is called from the init block  Is it possible to take apart initialization of a class  to different functions  if the properties are vals  Here is the code  Of course it s not compiling  because collectBroadcastAddresses function tries to reassign the broadcastAddresses val  Although I don t want to put the code of this function to the init block  because it s not obvious what the code is doing  and the function name tells it very nicely  What can I do in such cases  I d like to keep my code clean  this is the most important point

Kotlin Nested Object Classes Ok so i v been starting to learn kotlin for a week now  and i love the language p Besides the great utility of extension function  i feel like they lack a proper way of creating namespaces like java utility classes  xxxUtil   I have recently starting to use this aproach  which im not sure is the right one  and i would like some feedback from Kotlin experienced users  Is this a valid and proper thing todo  So  whenever i want to update some NormalNote value to a Realm Database  i do the following  Is this a common thing to do  Are there better approaches  As i understood  this is singleton nesting  i don t think there s any problem with this  i just don t like to put this common things like DB operations inside classes that need to be instantiated  In old java i opted to static classes

Writing a Kotlin util function which provides self reference in initializer I m trying to generalize my hack from an answer to another question  It should provide a way to reference a value which is not constructed yet inside its initializer  of course  not directly  but in lambdas and object expressions   What I have at the moment  It works  see this example  But at this point the way in which references the constructed value is property  And my question is  is there a way to rewrite so that is passed an argument  or a receiver  instead of using property  This question can be reformulated to  is there a way to pass a lazily evaluated receiver argument to a function or achieve this semantics some way  What are the other ways to improve the code  UPD  One possible way is to pass a function that returns   thus it would be used as inside the   Still looking for other ones

Recursive definition of infinite sequence in Kotlin I m experimenting with the Kotlin sequences and particular the more complicated ones that are not simple calculations on the previous value  One example I d like to define is a sequence of all prime numbers  An easy way to define the next prime is the next integer that is not divisible by any of the previous primes in the sequence  In Scala this can be translated to  I m having trouble translating this to Kotlin  In scala it works because you can pass function that returns a sequence that will be lazily evaluated but I can t do the same in Kotlin  In Kotlin I tried But that obviously doesn t work because the function is evaluated straight away and leads to an infinite recursion 
How to generate a kotlin file from an annotation processor  I have a java annotation processor which generates a bunch of java files during compilation  I d like to make the generated classes nicer to use in kotlin by adding extension methods  I ve been told on the kotlin forums that something I could try would be to write a kotlin file that contains my extension functions  I ve tried this  I used the object to create this file outputting it to the StandardLocations SOURCE OUTPUT directory  Intellij can see my generated class  and I can use the extension functions as intended  but the app won t compile because the compiler can t find the new kotlin file  Is there any way I can write a new kotlin file that ll get picked up by the kotlin compiler

Unresolved reference to debug directory in kotlin library module I m using Kotlin for the first time to develop an Android app  Currently I m working on a library module   data   inside my project  separate from the main app module  I ve come across a snag  whenever a file inside data src main references a file inside data src debug  the build process fails with the message  Unresolved reference   class name    However  it doesn t fail when I reference files inside data src release  In both cases I ve triple checked the syntax  directories  and build variants  I haven t modified the debug or release build types inside my build gradle files   I m using whatever their default settings are  My source sets are  The module is using the  com android library  and  kotlin android  plugins  All the files I ve tested with so far have been Kotlin files  though I don t know if this is a Kotlin issue or something else  Kotlin has otherwise been behaving  I figured this might be caused by the default debug settings  but I also testing app src main referencing app src debug  and that works correctly despite using the same default settings

When should one prefer Kotlin extension functions  In Kotlin  a function with at least one argument can be defined either as a regular non member function or as an extension function with one argument being a receiver  As to the scoping  there seems to be no difference  both can be declared inside or outside classes and other functions  and both can or cannot have visibility modifiers equally  Language reference seems not to recommend using regular functions or extension functions for different situations  So  my question is  when do extension functions give advantage over regular non member ones  And when regular ones over extensions  vs   Is it just a hint of a function semantics  receiver is definitely in focus  or are there cases when using extensions functions makes code much cleaner opens up opportunities

Kotlin object  singleton  with an Android Application Context I ve been looking into Android development using Kotlin and I ran into a situation  I m trying to figure out how to create a singleton using the recommended Kotlin  object  and pass it an Android Context  more specifically the context from the Context getApplicationContext   method  It s essentially the same question as here  but since Kotlin was in beta until just a few days ago  I was wondering if the answer might have changed for V1 0 0  I d rather not use the accepted answer in the referred question  use a setter to set the context  because it would mean I d have to  re set the context to make sure it s not null before using the singleton  Not a big deal  but it feels like there should be a better way  It might also raise issues when setting the context from different threads at the same time     Or maybe not  since the Context would always be the same Application Context  Using an injection library as suggested in the other answer to that question would work  but I m looking for a more  idiomatic  way of doing this since I m trying to learn the language  Anyone know another way  Thanks 
Java code cannot access Kotlin s package since Kotlin 1 0 0 I m using Kotlin along with Java in my gradle project  But since I ve updated Kotlin  and kotlin gradle pludin  to 1 0 0 strange things began to happen  There s a Java class that uses Kotlin objects  CategoryEntity and CommentEntity are written in Kotlin  This code was compiling and working well until 1 0 0 but now I got the following errors  The code wasn t modified after update and what s interesting   Android Studio static analyzer threats this code as working  but not compiler  I m wonder   if I missed anything in the Release notes of Kotlin 1 0 0 or it s a bug in the compiler  P S  I ve tried to put entities to the same package as the Contract class but  cannot find symbol class  errors didn t gone  Here s a portion of the build gradle of my app module SOLUTION  As Doug Stevenson pointed   there should be in the build gradle  Looks like I ve accidentally replaced it with instead of adding the new one  Now  when I returned kotlin android plugin line everything works well 
What is the correct way to deal with fields in Kotlin  How should I handle the migration from a Java class with fields to Kotlin properly  A couple of reading into Kotlin s docs reveal that their classes can t have fields defined within them  Being the rebel that I am  actually trying to convert my existing Java code to its Kotlin counterpart  using Android Studio s Java to Kotlin converter feature  also marks  fields  with an unpleasantly blinding highlight  This is my Java class    and this is what it looks like converted into a  kt  How can I do this the Kotlin way 
Why public class can t extend private class  I have a following class hierarchy  But I get the following error  I don t want to use anywhere else  so it s declared   and I want to use and in other files like this  But that error prevents me to create such a hierarchy  Why  What s wrong with it

In Kotlin  why Jackson fails unmarshalling non annotated object in some cases and not in others I m using Kotlin with Jongo to access MongoDB  Jongo uses Jackson to serialize deserialize objects in order to save and read them from MongoDB  I use Jackson Kotlin module to help serialize Kotlin data classes using constructors  Here s an example of a dataclass that serializes just fine  Here s an example of a similar class that fails to deserialize  Following exception is thrown by Jongo because Jackson deserialization fails  It does work if I fully annotate the Session data class like this  My question is  why does it work for Workflow  What s the subtle difference that makes unmarshalling fail for Session data class  when it s not fully annotated  EDIT Difference was that I tested Workflow test case running it from Gradle  which used different version of Kotlin then the Session test case that I run from IDEA IDE  Update of IDEA s Kotlin plugin also updated Kotlin version that IDEA uses to run test cases  which I didn t notice  This resulted in mismatched versions of Kotlin and Jackson Kotlin library  Accepted answer below pointed out what needs to be configured in order get things working again

UninferredParameterTypeConstructor exception during build when generic parameters not specified explicitly I have the following code  using RxKotlin 0 40 1   Just FYI this is needed to easily transform which may throw errors to an which always returns object  so is never triggered  And I want to use it like this  And Android Studio 1 5 1 with Kotlin plugin 1 0 0 release IJ141 56 doesn t highlight any errors in this code  But when I try to build it  I get the error  But when I change my function to everything compiles OK  But why I get that exception when I don t specify the generic parameters of explicitly if the IDE doesn t highlight any errors 
Hadoop Context type parameters in Kotlin When implementing a Hadoop Mapper or Reducer in Kotlin  I get an interesting contradiction from the compiler  Any time you use the object  the compiler gives an error saying  4 type arguments expected  if you don t supply type arguments     and says  No type arguments expected  if you DO supply type arguments  Any ideas what s happening here  An example  Specifying makes it compile  but since is an inner class of   shouldn t the type of the be implied when you specify the type of the you re extending  as it is in Java 
Comparing lists of comparables in Kotlin I m trying to write a function that compares two lists of comparables  The comparables can be of various types as long as the elements at the same positions in the two lists being compared are comparable  Example  This should print  1 because 10 == 10  xyz  ==  xyz   a  <  b  and thus list1 < list2  Here s the code that I have put together with a bit of a trial and error process since I m a little bit confused about how generics work in this specific case  And this actually compiles and works as expected  but there are a few things that I m puzzled about  My first attempt was with the following method signature  This did not compile though  Why is that  And how is this declaration different from the other one  Second  if I try comparing lists with incomparable values at the matching positions  I get a type cast error  For example  when comparing  1 1  to  1  abc    I get This apparently arises at the type cast in What puzzles me  How is the T resolved to Integer here  In fact  I m surprised that this actually compiles  And third  is there a way to get rid of the unchecked cast  I tried but that did not compile  Why  It seems that somehow it s known that T is meant to be Integer in this iteration  so why can t I type check against it

Why there are no concurrency keywords in Kotlin  I m just diving in to this amazing language  and this one thing is frustrating to me  Why there are no keywords for synchronization  So far my research gives up one solution  you wrap some high level classes and use them to handle concurrency    Given a project on pure kotlin  what one shall do if there is a need for small highly optimized component that handles concurrency etc    My impression is that kotlin is an assisting language for java  to write 90  of code in kotlin but have some java code that is not possible to express with kotlin  Is this right  Is this how it was intended to be

Using RxJava to join local data with remote   or cached   data This is working code but I have a few questions as well as a request for advice on improving it  I am new to RxJava and I have not fully wrapped my head around how to chain these type of observables together  I have two model objects  and   s exists in a local database and the is fetched from the server by using an ID provided from the   The web service accepts an array of IDs for which it will return a list of objects  The flow of this code is as follows  Load s from database Using the s fetched from the database  check an in memory cache to see if I ve already fetched the for a particular For any items whose is not cached  fetch them from the network Place the fetched objects into the cache Re run step 2   the method is   Return results to subscriber NOTE  The objects should only be fetched for a if the list has been deemed a   Here is the code  The user would initiate the sequence of events by calling  My questions about this code are  Currently takes in an array of and returns that same array as an observable after the cached items have been associated with it  This feels wrong to me  I think instead this call should only return the items that have a cached associated with it  However  I need to continue passing the full array of to the next method 2   Do I need to do additional work to support unsubscribing  3   This is similar question 1  My fetchUserInfoFo

How do I get a fixed number of resizing cells with no padding in javafx  Background  I m working on a visualizer for real time planning algorithms  The  world  is provided in a text file  where     is a free cell  and     is a blocked cell  The following is an example  It is very important that the window has the exact same number of cells in every row and the exact same number of cells in every column  I have to visualize in Kotlin  which is 100  interoperable with Java  I decided to try javafx  version 8 0 60  After doing some research on javafx layouts  I decided TilePane was my best bet  What I have so far  This is what I have so far  If you look closely  you can see a very small amount of padding within each node of the TilePane  As the robot goes from tile to tile  this small amount of padding introduces a slight error  because the robot moves using the width and height of the tile  not accounting for the padding  This causes the robot to not be in the center of the tile as it traverses the maze  Additionally  my solution is very dependent on the size of the window  If I adjust it slightly  the world is displayed incorrectly because each row and column do not have the same number of fixed cells  Questions  These questions are in order of importance  Is there a layout or setting that will provide me with a fixed number of cells per row and per column  Displaying the world depends on that  How do I get rid of the padding between each node in the layout  If possible  I would like to resize the layout  while maintaining the first two invariants  Does anyone know of a way to do this  Relevant parts of my code  Note  robot fill is the same as calling robot setFill  and Kotlin omits types and the keyword new when instantiating objects 
Any way to inherit from same generic interface twice  with separate types  in Kotlin  I have a scenario in my code where I would like a class to implement an interface for two separate types  like this example  Kotlin is not pleased with this  citing  I know that one possible solution is to implement the following code  where I implement the interface with and then check the types myself and delegate them to their functions  However  that feels like I m removing type safety and communication about what the class is used for  and is asking for trouble down the line  Is there a better way to implement this in Kotlin  Additionally   what s the reasoning behind it not being allowed the way I indicated in the first sample  Aren t interfaces just a contract of signatures I m required to implement  or is there something I m missing involving generics here

Package equivalent visibility modifier in Kotlin I m writing a program in which I m using the factory pattern  I have an interface called AssetFundCalculator and a class named AssetFundCalculatorImpl which implements the interface  The AssetFundValidator class validates some inputs  and is able to instantiate a valid AssetFundCalculatorImpl  I d like if the rest of the program would only know about the interface  and not about the AssetFundCalculatorImpl  so that only the AssetFundValidator could instantiate it  My package structure is looking like this  In Java  I would give package visibility modifier to the AssetFundCalculatorImpl class  or it s constructor  and it would solve the issue  but in Kotlin  there is no package visibility modifier  Is there a solution to this  I don t want to put this code to a separately compiled module  so the internal modifier is not going to work

How do I manage unit test resources in Kotlin  such as starting stopping a database connection or an embedded elasticsearch server  In my Kotlin JUnit tests  I want to start stop embedded servers and use them within my tests  I tried using the JUnit annotation on a method in my test class and it works fine  but it isn t the right behaviour since it runs every test case instead of just once  Therefore I want to use the annotation on a method  but adding it to a method results in an error saying it must be on a static method  Kotlin doesn t appear to have static methods  And then the same applies for static variables  because I need to keep a reference to the embedded server around for use in the test cases  So how do I create this embedded database just once for all of my test cases  Note  this question is intentionally written and answered by the author  Self Answered Questions   so that the answers to commonly asked Kotlin topics are present in SO 
Kotlin `typealias` feature According to the source of Kotlin s lexer  there is a keyword  and it s not  reserved for future use  like and   Also  the grammar reference suggests that should be a valid keyword for a class member declaration  and when I type in IntelliJ IDEA  Android Studio  with Kotlin plugin it recognizes it as a keyword but I get expecting member declaration error  I have also tried using it with the  usual  syntax  for example like it is implemented in Swift  however with no success  So  is the feature actually implemented in Kotlin  as of 1 0   and if so  what is the syntax for it  Is there any documentation that describes its use  Update Kotlin 1 1 supporting type aliases is now out

Unresolved reference  Kotlin needs 2 builds after clean to pick up code when using kapt In our Android app we re using DBFlow to access the SQLite database  We re referencing the classes generated by DBFlow via Kotlin  We are already aware of the fact that we have the model classes as well as the database class in Java as code generation won t work when writing these classes in Kotlin  However we still have to build the code twice after every project clean  Executing the first build on a device results in for seemingly random Kotlin classes  even if they don t access code generated by DBFlow or any of the model classes defined by us   The same is reported already at compile time when enabling Proguard which of course fails the build  The second build always succeeds  The funny thing is  that code generation already works at the first run   the classes are there and are also picked up by the IDE  But the compiler somehow can t find them making me think that the code generation happens too late in the build process  On the other hand as explained above there are also classes not found which don t have to do anything with code generation and or annotation processing  So is there a better solution to this problem than a second build  For reference  the relevant parts of our app s looks like this   just like the DBFlow documentation is suggesting  Edit  I found that I also have to rebuild twice for every change I make to the code  It compiles correctly in the first build if I didn t clean before  but the changes simply aren t picked up

Why doesn t Kotlin support  ternary operator  Explain  This question is more about the design intentions of Kotlin  Many expression languages support both and  e g   Ruby  Groovy   First of all  I know Groovy supports both and   Ternary operator in Groovy  So I don t think it s a syntax problem  Then the official documents said  And this doesn t convince me  Because Kotlin support which ordinary if works just fine in that role either  I think is sometimes better than ordinary   though I wonder why doesn t Kotlin just support

package protected alternative in kotlin In java we have package protected  as default  modifier for classes  which allows to have many classes in a single package but expose only few and keep the logic encapsulated  With kotlin this seems not to be the case  if i want to have few other classes that shall be visible to each other but not further i have to use private modifier which limits visibility to a single file    so essentially if you had 10 classes in a package and only one of those were public now you ll have one huge file with all the classes in it  and all over the place     Is this normal practice or there is a way to achieve the some similar modularity in kotlin  I don t understand if they have notion of package why did they get rid of package protected access

Is there any easy way to see what exceptions a Kotlin function throws  I mostly understand the potential issues with checked exceptions and why Kotlin omits them  However  the issue I am encountering is I can t find any foolproof way of clearly indicating to the caller what exceptions a function may throw  I have run into the issue countless times in Python where my program will crash after running for months because I didn t realise a function from some library I m using can raise a particular exception  Although being forced to catch exceptions can be quite problematic  it is nice to clearly see all the potential exceptions a function can throw  So back to the question  is there any simple way to see what exceptions a function throws in Kotlin  What about for methods written in Java that are being called from Kotlin  Even if just in tooling  intelliJ   I m not counting writing it in javadoc or kdoc as the writer of the function you re using may have omitted it

Function definition  fun vs val I m curious about what is the suggested way to define member functions in Kotlin  Consider these two member functions  These appear to accomplish the same thing  but I found subtle differences  The based definition  for instance  seems to be more flexible in some scenarios  That is  I could not work out a straight forward way to compose with other functions  but I could with   To toy around with these definitions  I used the funKTionale library  I found that this does not compile  But if were defined as a pointing to the same function  it would compile just fine  To figure out what was going on I asked IntelliJ to explicitly define the type of and for me  and it gives me this  So one is of type   the other is of type   It s easy to see that both represent functions of type   What is the difference between these two types  and in which cases does it matter  I noticed that for top level functions  I can compose them fine using either definition  but in order to make the aforementioned composition compile  I had to write it like so  i e  I had to partially apply it to first  Since I don t have to go through this hassle when using s for functions  is there a reason why I should ever define non Unit member functions using   Is there a difference in performance or semantics that I am missing

Getting KProperty Information from within Delegated Property outside getValue   and setValue   Functions I m trying to implement the JavaFX Property interface with a delegated Kotlin property  so that it can be used like so  I wrote up a small class for this that works  mostly   However  this class doesn t implement the interface s getBean   and getName   methods  They should return the values thisRef and property name  respectively  from the arguments referenced in the getValue   and setValue   functions  but I don t have access to those arguments from outside the functions  I could store the values the first time they re used  like so  But this seems like an awful hack  and it doesn t return the correct values for getBean   and getName   until the property is accessed once  Is there a way to get these values earlier without passing them into the constructor  like is required by SimpleObjectProperty

Kotlin constructor with super class Any way I try  be it primary constructors or secondary  I can t figure out how to declare a new class with a super class and a constructor in kotlin  This is how i would most like t do it but it gives an error expecting member declaration  this is how I thought a primary constructor looked but it gives the same error  Searching the internet hasn t been helpful and all I could find was the second example  So  what are all of the valid ways of creating a class with a super class and its one constructor 
kotlin infinite sequences with iterator function I am confused about how to create an infinite sequence in kotlin to use for lazy evaluation  In java  but sequences seem much more confusing then java streams  The sequence constructor is very confusing the doc for it says  but I don t know what it means by an iterator function or how to make one  I have this which compiles but obviously doesn t print anything  I don t think my iterator function makes any sense  It wants a function that takes no arguments and returns an iterator  which isn t like the java  iterate function at all  iterator happens to have a constructor that takes an array  which would make sense if I had a data set to work with in an array but I don t  I want to be working with an infinite sequence  There is no  limit  so I previously tried to add a  reduce but the arguments for  reduce were even more confusing  I think there should be a  toList but I knew it wasn t working so I didn t try it  If someone would show me how to implement the above java code in lotlin it would help a lot

Escape reserved words in an import When using Java classes in Kotlin  sometimes they use identifiers that are reserved word in kotlin  The java interop documentation says you can use backtick  `  character but this doesn t work in imports  So how to escaped reserved words on import  e g  The tinkerpop library has a class called      but thats a Kotlin reserved so if I import it like below it gives an error  I can import it using the wild card like this  but because I only use the one class then Intellij s code formatter replaces it with the previous version of the import that gives an error   Which I guess is a bug in the intellij formatter as well  For the answers that suggest using backtick ` works  It does not  This does not compile even on try kotlinlang org  Assuming a class exists defined as This is what happens when you import it with backticks 
How to return result in doInBackground after login API completion block is finished in UserLoginTask I used default LoginActivity in Android Studio and created a simple login view  In my app  the authentication task and access token generation is done by the server via API call  However  since the api call must have a completion block  my login function in also does  Therefore the authentication result exists in the thread of the completion block  which makes the returned result of the original to incorrect  The functions are overriden  so I cannot change their parameters and formats  I m still new in android developing and still not very familiar with its asynchronized task  so I would like to ask if there is any way to halt in and wait for the result in the completion block  Or is there any better solution to solve my API login  Thanks  Here the code of my UserLoginTask  written in kotlin but I think the concept would be the same with java

Does Kotlin custom get execute method call To increase the readability of calls to SharedPreferences Editor I want to use a Kotlin variable that will execute  getSharedPreferences edit    each time I need a new SharedPreferences Editor  Initially I was going to use something like this  But then I was informed that  editPreferences  will hold the reference to the same editor when what I really want it to create a new editor each time the  editPreferences  is called  If a custom getter was used would a new editor be returned each time  Something like this  Still getting up and running with Kotlin and am not sure if the get   method would hold reference to the editor instead of creating a new one

How to do PATCH properly in strongly typed languages based on Spring   example According to my knowledge    update object with its whole representation  replace    update object with given fields only  update  I m using Spring to implement a pretty simple HTTP server  When a user wants to update his data he needs to make a HTTP to some endpoint  let s say     His request body is mapped to a DTO via   which looks like this  Then I use an object of this class to update  patch  the user object  My doubt is  what if a client  web app for example  would like to clear a property  I would ignore such a change  How can I know  if a user wanted to clear a property  he sent me null intentionally  or he just doesn t want to change it  It will be null in my object in both cases  I can see two options here  Agree with the client that if he wants to remove a property he should send me an empty string  but what about dates and other non string types   Stop using DTO mapping and use a simple map  which will let me check if a field was given empty or not given at all  What about request body validation then  I use right now  How should such cases should be properly handled  in harmony with REST and all good practices  EDIT  One could say that shouldn t be used in such an example and I should use to update my User  But then what about API updates  adding a new property for example   I would have to version my API  or version user endpoint alone   after every User change    which accepts with an old request body  which accepts with a new request body  etc  I guess it s not the solution and exists for a reason

Kotlin delegation to expression instead of fixed reference Suppose I have a very intricate specification defined as an interface  And a standard implementation  Now suppose that I want to create a class that implements this specification and delegates to an implementation  but the exact delegate object is mutable throughout the object s lifetime  Here s an example  The problem with the above example is that the constructor argument is set as the delegate object when the constructor is called  The delegate is then accessed by the class directly instead of performing a property access   This has been confirmed by looking through the bytecode produced by Kotlin   So  even if the property is modified after the class is constructed  the delegate does not change  Can anybody provide a method for performing this delegation in Kotlin without having to write out every single method  An ideal solution would also allow for delegation to something as general as a lambda or other expression that would be evaluated and used as the delegate whenever the delegate is needed throughout the lifetime of the object

Why does context not have the activity s primary color attribute  I m writing a library that has an activity for photo editing  When the user is done editing  there is a  done  button with a color background  I want to be able to customize the color of the button so I have static methods in a different class that create drawables with different colors  Something that I want to do in this class is a function that receives a reference and creates a drawable with the primary color  Here s my code  This function gets the primary color from the and returns a drawable with that color  The problem is that the primaryColor attribute is not found  so it returns a colorless drawable  What s even weirder is that if instead I fetch the primary color in my activity and then call the static method  it works  Here s the code  So the real question is  Why does fail when called from my static method using the activity s context reference  but it succeeds when called from the activity 
Kotlin performance of Interface vs Function Invocation In Kotlin  as we can use functions as variables  i tend to replace interfaces with function calls like this  As I m pretty new to Kotlin  i would like to know the differences and in what scenarios should i use function calls vs interfaces  except for the  obviously  abstraction  Or is it the same  and the function call does exactly the same as anonymous inner classes The function is called many times  each 100s precisely  and i would like to know  in terms of performance  which on is better

How can I more easily use Jooq transactions in Kotlin I have Jooq code written in Kotlin using transactions  and sometimes I want a method to work stand alone as a top level action that will have its own transactions  and other times want it to work composited with other methods within the same transaction  For example  I have two lower level functions and that I want to compose into different higher level data methods and inherit their transaction if present  otherwise have their own  I know in Spring or other frameworks there are annotations that can be added that validate  transaction required  or  create transaction if none  type functionality  But how do I do the same with Jooq + Kotlin without using those libraries  The closest I came up with is to pass the transaction in as an optional parameter and default it to a new transaction if missing  But if someone forgets to pass in the transaction  then has the subtle failure of using a new top level and unrelated transaction  I don t want that  How do I do this more naturally  and less dangerously  Note  this question is intentionally written and answered by the author  Self Answered Questions   so that the answers to commonly asked Kotlin topics are present in SO

API call not working inside Anko Async I m trying to make an http request in Android  using Kotlin  and I ve come across two ways of doing so  One is the traditional way  using  not really pretty  which I got to work with the following code  just the   as the rest of the class seemed unnecessary   Now  I ve come across a library called Anko  which many here know  and I tried to use its DSL for asynchronous tasks  The thing is  I haven t found a lot of info here about Anko for asynchronous tasks  so I thought I would open a new topic to see if someone could walk me through what I m doing wrong  or what they think I should do to make it work  The code I wanted to use is the following  I tried to keep it as slim as possible so to minimize any potential mistakes  but I must be doing something wrong here because the code inside the async block is not doing anything  yet the app is not crashing and I m not getting any exceptions  I ve tried debugging it using Intellij IDEA  but after the first line inside the async block it stops the debugging while saying  The application is running   My best guess is that it got hung up somewhere in that first line due to the failed connection  but I don t know  I ve also tried to use the regular inside the async block  but that hasn t worked either  Anyway  any help would be deeply appreciated

Skip if empty in Kotlin Maven plug in We have enabled the Kotlin Maven plug in in our top most project POM  like this  ATM  only a handful of the modules in this project have Kotlin source code   The project is around 50 modules   The idea is that most will eventually have Kotlin code  and we don t want to have to wire things up on a per project basis  We want to configure it once  and forget about it  This works except that we get this warning in the build for most modules  We had this problem with the JAR plug in as well  That plug in has a configuration option that allows us to do like this  This shutup that plug in s similar warnings  The Kotlin compiler plug in doesn t seem to have any such config option though  So  my questions are  Is there such a configuration option that we re overlooking  Should we configure the Kotlin compiler plug in differently to avoid this warning  TIA 
How to compose nullables in Kotlin Let s imagine you have 2 fonctions returning nullable and you cant to compose this 2 functions   To achieve the composition  I wrote this functions   Is it possible to compose 2 nullable values to get another nullable without explicitly writing and   In Scala I would just do something like   Should I use java Optional to achieve this or is it possible with operator  Thanks   
Sort collection by multiple fields in Kotlin Let s say I have a list of People which I need to sort by Age first and then by Name  Coming from a C  background  I can easily achieve this in said language by using LINQ  How does one accomplish this using Kotlin  This is what I tried  it s obviously wrong since the output of the first  sortedBy  clause gets overridden by the second one which results in a list sorted by Name only

Single Kotlin+libgdx codebase deployed to Android  desktop and browser  Is this possible  I m thinking that deploying to both Android and desktop shouldn t be too hard  since Java can already do it   I learned that Kotlin can also be transpiled to JavaScript  Does this mean that I can deploy the same codebase to all three targets  or will I need different code for the browser   is it even possible to use libgdx when targeting the browser with Kotlin

How does Kotlin property access syntax work for Java classes  I m trying to switch my Android project to Kotlin  I have an  a subclass of   for which I want to set a hint and text programmatically  The hint works as expected  For text  though  I m getting a type mismatch exception if I try to do it using Kotlin setter syntax  If we look at the declaration  we ll find identical signatures inherited from   I had an impression that was a shortcut for but apparently that impression was wrong  is treated as a normal method rather than a setter  but what s the difference between these two methods that makes the compiler behave differently  The only one I can think of is that has an property but I don t think it might be the case  Another thing I don t quite understand is  where does come from  There is no corresponding method  nor is there a public field of this type  Thanks

Are Kotlin object singleton s methods synchronized  Does it make any sense to add the annotation to an object s methods to make them atomic or it isn t needed  For example  I want to ensure that all the fields are updated when I read them from other objects  Should I keep the annotation 
Which is the preferred syntax when using annotation based dependency injection in Kotlin  We re using an existing framework which   among other things   provides dependency injection through annotations  In Java  to inject field value we would do something like this  Since reflection allows to reassign fields that are normally final  this also a valid declaration  To make the declaration even shorter  and also make the fields available in unit test classes  while keeping them a part of semi private API   you could do it like this  When it comes to Kotlin  we re stuck with this  Nullable type approach requires additional null check  or operator  on every service use  even though we re 100  sure they will never be null   unless something went completely wrong  in which case we have bigger problems  approach seems to perform unnecessary checks at runtime  which are  well  highly unlikely to become performance bottlenecks  but still  and is rather verbose  Both approaches allow to reassign the variable to another value  We re yet to find a way of replacing with without overriding getter or using a back up field  which faces the same problem  Ironically  they are both longer than Java declarations in many cases  So   what is the preferred way of declaring annotated Kotlin fields  which will be injected automatically and we re 100  sure that they will never be null  While I understand that there are multiple frameworks with Kotlin friendly syntax solving similar problems  like Injekt   I m asking if there s a nicer way of doing it with what we have

RxJava  Turn Observable into Iterator  Stream  or Sequence I know this breaks a lot of Rx rules  but I really like RxJava JDBC and so do my teammates  Relational databases are very core to what we do and so is Rx  However there are some occasions where we do not want to emit as an but would rather just have a pull based Java 8 or Kotlin   But we are very accustomed to the RxJava JDBC library which only returns an   Therefore  I am wondering if there is a way I can turn an into a using an extension function  and not do any intermediary collection or calls  Below is all I have so far but my head is spinning now trying to connect push and pull based systems  and I cannot buffer either as the is stateful with each call  Is this an impossible task

Null Pointer Exception In Spring Proxy Class and Kotlin I am facing some problems with kotlin in conjunction with spring  I have a controller bean  without an interface btw  which has an auto wired service bean via the primary constructor  It works perfectly unless I use caching annotations for the controller  Apparently springs caching generates a proxy class under the hood which deals with the caching  My code looks like this  The problem now is a null pointer exception when the method is executed  actually is which technically is not possible as it is a nonnull variable in kotlin  I assume that class proxies generated by spring initialize the class with null values instead of the autowired bean  This must be a common pitfall using kotlin and spring  How did you circumvent this problem 
Proto3 setting value equal to default is not recognised in runtime is not as strict as   and there are no or fields  there are no custom values  Given the following definition    There are default values for any of those fields  after all now there are no rules of what you must or must not provide before you your object  So the default for is   is and is   if you print an instance where you did not provide one of the fields or provided the default value then runtime will treat it as it was never provided in both cases  so its not possible to determine if the value was manually set to or it was taken as the default  For example if we execute the following code  its kotlin  we will have this output at the very least this is annoying as when you print your proto objects using standard or json printer you ll have this cropped output    But what if your client does not necessarily care about default values and expects all fields to be present  Question   is there a way to change this behaviour  at the very least how do we ensure that if value was set it is being shown  Maybe there is a way to tell to generate different code  affecting defaults behaviour

Method not being called  no error  maybe has to do with generics companion objects inheritance concurrency inlining Okay  so I have a class called ChannelBase which is the superclass for all channel type things in Slack  basically just Channels and Groups as MPIMs aren t considered groups anymore  Within ChannelBase there is an  the generic is the type of the subclass  aka or    The subclass then has its companion object extend ChannelCompanion  which forces it to have a function  and provides the companion object with a that gathers the channel list from the Slack API and parses it  So basically here s what we have  let s assume we re registering the class  When  inherited from ChannelCompanion  is called  here is what should happen   > Call  > Asynchronously make HTTP request to a slack team s channels list method  > Parse the JSON and retrieve the array of Channel JsonObjects  > Parse each JsonObject into a Channel object using  an abstract fun in ChannelCompanion  The problem is that when gets called  the Thread freezes  There is no error or exception  it just freezes  If you don t understand the structure of this  it s hard to explain   here is the repository   Debug code shows that the program freezes when is called  The first line of is to print that the function was run  and it doesn t print  The line before it gets called is printed  though  Not quite sure what s going on here  It is good to note that while there are multiple threads  this is all executed in the same thread after the HTTP request is made  If you want to clone the repository and test for yourself   In the JUnit test directory  go to BaseTest and replace the encrypted API key with an API key for a Slack team of your own

How to create variables on parent context I m trying to implement something similar to this syntax in Kotlin Right now this won t work because cannot be resolved within   I understand that this is due to the way the closures work  My question is if there is some mechanism in Kotlin that would allow me to do this  create variables in a closure extension in such a way that they would be stored in the receiver object and be accessible to other closures extensions  This is part of an effort to migrate a Groovy script to Kotlin  Disclaimer  This is my very first go at Kotlin  I ve read through the docs but I may be missing something  a lot   Feel free to just point at the right direction EDIT  Adding compilable example
How can I pause an event from flowing through an observable  I am trying to create an Observable that can be paused in such a way that items stop being pushed through the observable until it becomes unpaused  At which point  I d like it to resume processing all of the unprocessed items  My data source comes from outside the class  so what I have winds up looking like this  What I m aiming for is that the function would stop the events from even going to the server  but would hold on to them until an eventual    At the point happens  we d send the events   Obviously we d add in some extra help for back pressure in case we had too many events during the paused state  I ve tried various uses of buffering and windowing in order to make this work  but it never actually pauses the observable  Instead  one of two things happens  The event is dropped entirely  in the case of an unsubscribe  filter  etc   The event flows through as though nothing has happened  Is there anything I can do to support this use case  Or should I be writing this under the expectation that one of the above two outcomes is what will happen

In Kotlin  how to delegate to an interface and provide only a no arg public constructor  The problem arises from the fact that Kotlin class delegation allows to delegate only to constructor parameters  thus seemingly forcing you to provide constructor with an argument  Below is my original question pertaining to concrete use case of this problem  I want to do the following  where inherits from ImmutableTable  src  or at least Table and I do not have to manually delegate all the methods to some base implementation  I also want to avoid the following  i e  I do not want to be forced to use companion objects   static factory methods  I tried to extend   but I am getting   I tried to extend interface and delegate to it  to avoid reimplementing methods  but then I am forced to provide an instance of as constructor parameter  I cannot just initialize it in block  Please see this gist for my exact attempts  Kotlin version used

Array List iteration without extra object allocations I m working on a game written in Kotlin and was looking into improving GC churn  One of the major sources of churn are for loops called in the main game rendering loops that result in the allocation of iterators  Turning to the documentation  I found this paragraph   Is this really true  To verify  I took this simple Kotlin program and inspected the generated byte code  According to the quote above  this should not result in any objects allocated  but get compiled down to a good old pre Java 5 style for loop  However  what I got was this  This looks to me as if a method called is called that allocates a temporary object to back up bounds checking in this loop  How is this an  optimal implementation  with  no extra objects created   or am I missing something  UPDATE  So  after toying around a bit more and looking at the answers  the following appears to be true for Kotlin 1 0 2  Arrays    range allocation   no allocation   no allocation   no allocation Collections  range allocation   no allocation   iterator allocation   iterator allocation

Why is Integer parameter of Java method mapped to Int and not platform type  Inspired by another question  In library there s class which has a method with the following Java signature  From Kotlin it is seen as Is there a specific reason why it is and not platform type   I expected it to be at least because a method with the same signature defined in Java source within the project with Kotlin sources has as parameter type seen from Kotlin  even defined in different module  and even imported from jar of that module    Also  the described behavior causes to conflict with  in the same class  which has parameter legally    they are both seen as   If there was for   there would be no conflict  I tried also to define this pair of methods in my code    still works as I expect  there s    Kotlin version is   Gradle dependency for

Merging data from different Observables  and choosing different fetching strategies  depending on data availability I have a situation  in which  by fetching an object  one of three things should happen  If the item is not present in cache  a k a is null   then load data from both   and   merge the data and return an   If the item is present in cache  but a certain piece of it is missing  load data from   and merge it with the already available data in the cache if the entire data is available in the cache  simply return it  So far  this is the best that I have managed to come up with  This works OK  so far  but I have been wondering  if there is a more declarative way to achieve the same effect  Suggestions are welcome

Kotlin with JPA Hibernate  no lazy loading without `open`  Most Kotlin JPA example code looks like this or even Now  the Hibernate User Guide  and I think also several other ORMs  state that they usually want to create proxies or otherwise extend the model class  but to allow that in Kotlin the class has to be explicitly defined   This is currently impossible with data classes and I assume  judging from my own experience  that most people don t think about it when writing JPA entities in Kotlin  So  to come to my question  this is stackoverflow after all   is it enough to do or would we actually have to do to not needlessly hinder the ORM at doing its job properly  If it really is harmful  we should probably propose to add a warning to IntelliJ IDEA  that if a class is has an annotation  it should be defined

How to properly override a method returning an instance of generic class in Kotlin I have an abstract generic class  And I have a subclass of it  Also I have a class with a protected abstract method  And I have it overridden in a subclass  Android Studio highlights the overridden function cast saying  This cast never succeed   I tried using   and and it doesn t work  When I tried to use I could not use the method in the class where it is originally defined  Android Studio complains about type mismatch  required Nothing   found BaseFragment  In Java the same code would work perfectly and I didn t think that it would be a problem in Kotlin  What is the right way to implement this

Effective Enums in Kotlin with reverse lookup  I m trying to find the best way to do a  reverse lookup  on an enum in Kotlin  One of my takeaways from Effective Java was that you introduce a static map inside the enum to handle the reverse lookup  Porting this over to Kotlin with a simple enum leads me to code that looks like this  My question is  is this the best way to do this  or is there a better way  What if I have several enums that follow a similar pattern  Is there a way in Kotlin to make this code more re usable across enums

Android local VPN Service  can not forward packets I m trying to implement simple Android firewall app through VPN service  Basic scheme looks like this  I m trying to simply forward packets through my VPN service  So I ve started with implementing ToyVpn Google example  time to time taking a glance at this example  for my purposes  but it s not working  when my VPN is running I see that packets are sent  but I ve got no response  App is written on Kotlin  but it s not complicated for Java lovers  My Builder is configured with IP and route as shown below  After that I m setting a tunnel a way it s shown in ToyVpn  but my VPN server destination IP address is local  After that I m trying to forward packets from and FileInputStream s  also taken from ToyVpn   My first question  What am I doing wrong  The code is clear and should work properly  but it does not  Basicly I want my service to fitler packets by IP address  I know that huge apps like tPacketCapture parse packets from the scratch and than reconstruct them  My second question  Is there a way to make packet filtering simplier if I want to fetch only the IP address  P S   Actualy I ve already asked a similar question about it here a few days ago  but error had another nature related to Kotlin language  which app is developed on  Also I ve seen this and this questions  but the answers there didn t help me

jvm comparing String with StringBuffer reverse   always fails I had a problem where I was to find all he substrings of a string that are palindromes  Input would always be 1 word  The test input was aabaa  I decided to try be clever and make a string buffer of my substring then use the reverse method to compare with the original using String equals  It didn t work  When I uncomment the first print statement the output look like this using test input aabaa So I am getting the correct substrings  but the last if statement never resolves true and I don t know why this is

Getters and Setters in Kotlin I m new in Kotlin and I m trying to figure out how to use getters and setters  In Java  for example  I can write getters on my own generate by IDE  or use Annotations like  Getter in lombok   which was pretty simple  Kotlin however has getters and setters by default   But I can t understand how to use it  I want to make it  lets say   similar to java  So how getters work 
Kotlin s List missing  add    remove  etc  In Java we could do the following But if we rewrite it to Kotlin directly as below I got the error of not finding and function from my List I work around casting it to ArrayList  but that is odd needing to cast it  while in Java casting is not required  And that defeats the purpose of having the abstract class List Is there a way for me to use List but not needing to cast it  like what could be done in Java

How to turn a Mutable Collection into an Immutable one I was writing a small piece of code in which I internally handle my data in a mutable map  which in turn has mutable lists  I wanted to expose my data to the API user  but to avoid any unsafe publication of my data I wanted to expose it in immutable collections even when internally being handled by mutable ones  I managed to expose only and  which are immutable  in the public API of my class  but the instances I am actually exposing are still inherently mutable  Which means an API user could simply cast my returned map as an ImmutableMap and gain access to the precious private data internal to my class  which was intended to be protected of this kind of access  I couldn t find a copy constructor in the collection factory methods or and so I was wondering what is the best and most efficient way to turn a mutable collection into an immutable one  Any advice or recommendations

Kotlin  Modifying  immutable  List through cast  is it legitimate  As we know the List in Kotlin is immutable i e  you can t do add and remove as below  But if we cast it to ArrayList as below  the add and remove works  I just thought this is odd  as myList is really a List  which is suppose to be immutable  And casting it  allow it to be altered  Is what done above  casting to Array and modify the content  legitimate  or the language need to improve to disallow that 
How do I avoid object expressions for functions that return a SAM interface I am a kotlin newbie so maybe this is trivial but I failed to find any relevant help at kotlinlang org  In an effort to learn a bit about kotlin I like to implement library  I wanted to define the fundamental types something like this  AFAIK type aliases isn t supported yet so above is just pseudocode  So my first attempt was this  kotlin then says  I seem to be able to get around it with  But that s not the signature I want especially for the more advanced operators I might need to specify the full function type  This I believe makes the API harder to read  What I could do is using an object expression  This works but I would like to use Lambda expressions to keep the code more succinct  Any tips welcome  Also if you know of any interesting blogs presentations on programming with higher order functions in kotlin that would also be much appreciated

How to perform multistep initialization of val In order learn a bit of I am building a parser combinator library based loosely on the classic paper Monadic Parser Combinators   In my case I need to forward declare a parser because of recursive syntax  When preparing the final expression parser I need to update the forward declaration My first attempt was this The idea is to perform a short initalization then return to initialize the value  This is a very common pattern when I do some F  programming and I think it s a good pattern because it simplifies hiding initialization details  This doesn t work in however  This approach also fails  The problem seem to be that combines two into a   So I tried in the hope that it behaves somewhat like C C++ but no luck  After reading the specification I found no clear solutions so that s why I turned to StackOverflow  Can this pattern be implemented in an idiomatic way in   Update  Eric suggested the use if and if I update my code with that the final solution ends up a bit like this  That it is acceptable to me  Thanks  Eric

Kotlin object vs companion object vs package scoped methods I have written this methods in Kotlin and analysed the bytecode  Situation 1 Situation 2 Situation 3 Bytecode Result Situation 1  class   Situation 2  class   Situation 3  class   My questions are  I have an enum class  and I want to return an enum instace given an enum variable  for instance  findById   How would I do it  Companion Object  object  It seems the only way to have a real static method is in package level  without class declaration  But that becomes a little bit too global  Is there any way to access it via    staticMethod being really static  Provide meaningfull examples of package declaration methods  companion object and object  Context  I have been coding in Kotlin and I find it amazing  But sometimes I need to make a decision  for example  a heavy immutable property which in java I would declare as static final  but in Kotlin I find it hard to  find an equivalent  
What is the best way to handle null situations in Kotlin when extending a Java class  I m really stuck with situation when something can be null in Kotlin  When a value cannot be null   it is clear  But how to handle situation when something can be null by default  Take a look at this example  So I should handle that situation this way  But what if map is null  What should I do in this case  I ve faced this problem while using java  Ok  in java  if map is null  we will get NPE  And for me NPE is better than nothing  The program crashes and this is a signal for me  that something is wrong and I should fix it  In this way  I can t even trace my problem and why it is happen  Yeah  we can write something like  and there is some meaning in this code  yes  But there is still some hesitation in me head about the whole null safety thing  Safe calls for example is weird thing which produces null and  In my opinion  heisenbugs or bugs that are hard to catch  Can someone explain to me what is going on here  and what are the best practices to use null safety  I m pretty sure that this thing is useful  because I m not as smart as guys in JB
Why does Generic Algebraic Data Types require `T` on member types  I want to define a Generic Algebraic Data Type for use with my function like this  However this is not allowed as is then an undefined reference  If I add to all member types it works  To me this is somewhat confusing which makes me believe I am missing something here  Why isn t seen when defining the member types in the first case  In addition when creating an instance of I would expect the syntax to be  But that won t work instead I do this  This is the preferable syntax to me but I am struggling to understand why I should leave out on Result here 
Kotlin Anonymous Function Parameter Unit Testing As per Kotlin Unit Testing for Function Parameter and Object  we could test the function variable   as it is an object function variable  However if code is written using anonymous inlining function parameter  which is a very nice Kotlin feature  that allow us to eliminate unnecessary temp variable for it     How to write my unit test that test this part of code  Or the inlining of the function parameter  as above  is something not good for unit testing  and hence should be avoided

Kotlin recommended way of unregistering a listener with a SAM So i have an interactor which performs an insert operation with Realm and then notifies that the insertion is completed with a RealChangeListener  It is something like this  I can do it this way  And access like this  But then i have no way of removing this listener will point to the class its located not the actual listener I can also do this  But then i have a SAM inside another SAM  too overkill imo  I can do it like this  Which works but it is too verbose  So how do you deal with this and what is considered the best approach

Is Groovy knowledge required to understand Gradle  So  I ve been trying to avoid build tools for a while  but started to use Gradle for some time now  I m able to use it for simple things like letting it download dependencies  like it s intended  but I ve seen people use it to do really advanced staff like manage large projects with different modules  native dependencies  publish to Github when building  etc  I feel like I still need to copy paste a lot when trying to do anything more complicated  because even after finding some documentation to read  I m still not sure where language syntax like                are meant to be used  So  my question is  Does it make sense to learn Groovy to understand Gradle better  Should reading the docs be enough  I m not even asking because I would not be interested in Groovy  I m just wondering how people got used to using Gradle and whether it makes sense to use it for more advanced tasks then fetching dependencies from repositories 
Spring Boot with AsyncRestTemplate Netty Client Fails I have a Spring Boot 1 3 6 application  built out of the box and using the embedded Tomcat server  The application has a single endpoint doing a very simple echo request  Later I defined a corresponding client invoking that simple endpoint using   however if my client uses the the request fails  otherwise it succeeds  My example below is in Kotlin  but it fails just the same in Java  so it does not have to do with the language I use to implement it  The Server My endpoint looks like this  And the order data class is Note  Since I use Kotlin  I also added the Kotlin Jackson Module to ensure proper constructor deserialization  The Client I then proceeded to create a client that invokes this endpoint  If I do something like the following in my client  it works perfectly and I get a successful echo response  As mentioned above  the code above runs perfectly and prints a successful echo response  The Problem But if I decide to use the Netty client  then I get 400 Bad Request reporting I did not pass the body  When I do this then I get a with a message saying  Required request body is missing   I debugged the Spring Boot code and I see that when the is read  it always return  1 as if it was empty  In my gradle I added   so I am using what  as of today  is the latest version of Netty  This Netty version has worked just fine when interacting with endpoints in other projects that I have that use regular Spring  i e  not Spring Boot   How come the works fine  but the fails  I thought it might had to do with the embedded Tomcat server  however  if I package this application as war and deploy it in an existing Tomcat server  i e  not using the embedded one   the problem persists  So  I m guessing is something related to Spring Spring Boot  Am I missing any configuration in my Spring Boot app  Any suggestions on how to make the Netty client work with Spring Boot 
Should properties of class in Kotlin be private and how to access them  Aloha  While reading Kotling Language Reference I noticed that the keyword  private  for properties of a class is never used  always default which is public   It also said that getters and setters are generated automatically  So I created class and made its fields private  However  when I create object of the class  I cannot see the fields and no setters and getters are available  unless I write them myself  So what s the rule here  Leave visibility modifier default  public  or make them private and provide mutator methods  Thank you

Why do we use  companion object  as a kind of replacement for Java static fields in Kotlin  What is the intended meaning of  companion object   So far I have been using it just to replace Java s when I need it  I am confused with  Why is it called  companion   Does it mean that to create multiple static properties  I have to group it together inside block  To instantly create a singleton instance that is scoped to a class  I often write   which seems like an unidiomatic way of doing it  What s the better way

Scope of variable defined in for loop header I noticed that the following Kotlin code compiles and executes successfully  This prints   However  I failed to find rationale behind the decision to allow this kind of variable shadowing  I would say that this is not a good practice  and is prohibited even in Java  I think that Kotlin designers did a great work of improving Java syntax and accommodating it to the everyday practical use  so I must be missing something here 
Fix generic type to the type of the first parameter I want to write an extension function which will be available on any type and accept parameter of the same type or subtype  but not a completely different type  I tried naive approach but it didn t work  It seems that compiler just uses Any for T  I want T to be fixed to receiver type 
Should Kotlin files be put in a separate source directory in Android  I m going to start using Kotlin for Android development in addition to Java because of its benefits  I have installed the Android Studio plugin and included the relevant dependencies in my gradle files  So I ve read from the Kotlin documentation and Stack Overflow that it s possible to include a separate source directory for Kotlin files  like so  I know I can create this directory by adding the following to my file  My question is  should Kotlin files  live  with Java files in the same directory or not  In addition to opinions  I would like to know whether there is a particular convention for this  and if so  why it is the way that it is  If not  then what are the advantages and disadvantages of each option

Java doesn t allow final default methods   but does Kotlin  If you attempt to create an inline function on an interface  you will face an error  I understand that this is because the function is virtual because it can be overridden  If we were able to declare  closed  functions  these functions would not be virtual  and therefore able to be inlined which is very useful  Using  private  gives us a non virtual   closed  function  but then the rest of the world can t use it  So   is there a way to define  closed  non virtual inlineable functions for abstract types   p s  I intend to answer this question myself but feel free to share your own answers

Kotlin  Is there a way to clean up number overloads  Often I find myself creating lots of overloads for number types because Kotlin doesn t do implicit conversions for non literals  This results in a huge amount of duplicate overload functions which is tons and tons of boilerplate  An example of the pain I have doing this can be seen here   I understand the reason why implicit conversions can cause bugs  but I think in most cases  especially for  enlargement  conversions like and where data isn t lost there should be a better way  So    my question is how do you deal with this  Are there any creative ways to solve this problem

In Kodein dependency injection  how can you inject instances of Kodein itself into instances  In Kodein  I have modules imported into a parent module  and sometimes the classes need an instance of Kodein so they can do injection themselves later  The problem is this code  Where needs the Kodein instance for later  but Kodein isn t yet created  Passing it later into the module seems like a bad idea  In Kodein I see there is the module that has a global instance  but I want to avoid the global  How do other modules or classes get the Kodein instance  Note  this question is intentionally written and answered by the author  Self Answered Questions   so that the idiomatic answers to commonly asked Kotlin Kodein topics are present in SO 
With Kodein dependency injection  I don t want to pass around kodein instances everywhere Using Kodein  I find I have to pass kodein instances around or inject them into modules and classes  But sometimes I have classes that are so disconnected I want them just to be able to discover  one true Kodein   Since this is a server side app  and I only have one Kodein scope it should be easy  I can create a global object  such as  But that doesn t work when some of the modules are re used across different projects and we cannot easily share this one instance  Maybe a separate module just to hold the global would work  but then it would need to be a and I d prefer it not be changeable  Can Kodein find a main  top level or global scope on its own  Note  this question is intentionally written and answered by the author  Self Answered Questions   so that the idiomatic answers to commonly asked Kotlin Kodein topics are present in SO

Passing parameters to a custom getter in kotlin I have been reading about properties in Kotlin  including custom getters and setters  However  I was wondering if it is possible to create a custom getter with extra parameters  For example  consider the following method in Java  Note that the static method in has to have as a parameter  so removing this is not an option  I would like to write it like this in Kotlin  But my IDE highlights all of this in red  I am aware I can create a function in my class to get the displayed value  but this would mean I would have to use in Kotlin as well instead of being able to refer to the property by name as in   Is there a way to create a custom getter like this  EDIT  If not  would it be best to write a function for this  or to pass into the parameters of the class constructor

Kotlin  Can you use named arguments for varargs  For example  you might have function with a complicated signature and varargs  It would make sense that you should be able to call this function like so  Unfortunately the compiler doesn t allow this  Is it possible to use named arguments for varargs  Are there any clever workarounds

Kotlin  Curly braces around several expressions  or statements  I think this question is somewhat related to Kotlin function declaration  equals sign before curly braces In Scala  every statement is an expression  possibly with type   If we surround multiple expressions with braces  then the final expression is the actual value of the curly braced part  Therefore  The type of is and the code prints the value   However  in Kotlin  this is somewhat different  If we do the same thing in the Kotlin  The type of is and the code prints the   which means a 0 ary function object with result type   So if we want to print the value   we need to do   In fact  the expression in Kotlin is a function   I cannot find an explanation about this in Kotlin official reference pages  Without a parameter list or   curly braces make a function  When I use Scala  I write many codes like the first code  However  in Kotlin  it creates a function object and we have to call the function  which may be an overhead in a loop or recursion  Is there any document about this thing  just curly braces make a function object  Any way to workaround the overhead in the second code if it is used many times  EDIT Here is the actual code that iterates many times  in Java in Scala in Kotlin You can see  only Kotlin makes a lot of function objects and calls them

Android Kotlin Realm Proper Way to Query+Update Async I recently faced a problem in which i had in memory a RealResult List of objects and was showing it in a view  Upon user click  the current showing item should be marked as deleted in realm  property   So i was just getting that object from the lazy list  open a transaction and mark it deleted  As the RealmResults are auto updated  i had a change listener bound to a   Everything works fine except this warning  Which is problematic because my list is enormous and i don t want the query to become   I solved it this way  which i don t know it it is right  Instead of giving the item object to the update function  i give the id of the object  and then do this  The problem which im unsure is the part of the query inside an async transaction  Edit  Actually  it throws Edit2  Tried this and show Realm access on different thread 
How to write a package level static initializer in Kotlin  A previous question shows how to put a static initializer inside a class using its   I m trying to find a way to add a static initializer at the package level  but it seems packages have no companion object  I ve tried other variations that might ve made sense   on its own     and I know as a workaround I can use a throwaway as in but is there a clean  official way to achieve the same result  Edit  As  mfulton26 s answer mentions  there is no such thing as a package level function really in the JVM  Behind the scenes  the kotlin compiler is wrapping any free functions  including in a class  I m trying to add a static initializer to that class    the class being generated by kotlin for the free functions declared in the file 
Android Kotlin Realm Proper Way of Query+ Return Unmanaged Items on Bg Thread What is the proper way of querying and returning an unmanaged result of items with realm  everything in the background thread   I m using somethibf like this  And then chaining this observable with another one that will post the results to a server  The solution working  although is a bit ugly on this aspects  No proper way of wrapping the realmQuery in an observable  because there is no way of opening a realInstance in a background thread without this kind of cheat  at least that i know about   so i need to use this fake observable   Not the best place to open and close Realm instances  inside first and second map I don t know if it is guaranteed that the realm instance is closed after all the items have been copied  So what is the proper way of Query and Return unmanaged results on the background thread  some context  i need this to send the results to a server  in the background and as this task is totally independent from my app current data flow  so it should be off the main thread   Suggested Version

Spring Boot Controller Locale Not Changing with Parameter I m having some trouble with using Spring Boot with Kotlin to handle locale  I created these settings in my application properties file  Then created an autowired instance of MessageSource in my controller  When put a locale in the url as a parameter  the parameter doesn t seem to get picked up when I call   so it is always en US  Though  I can manually pick it up using as a parameter to my controller function and use it from there in the controller function  but not in other functions  I thought that spring boot LocaleContextHolder was supposed to hold the current locale based on the request URL automatically for the whole session  I read an older article that mentioned using a LocaleChangeInterceptor bean as well as beans for MessageSource and LocaleResolver in your main class  but another article said Spring Boot doesn t require that  I tried it anyway with no difference  These are the functions I used  Any suggestions on what to try next other than capturing the locale manually and making it a parameter in every function that gets called by the controller  Thanks

Does Kotlin have method CALL labels  I m moving from Swift to Kotlin  and loving it so far  However  I m used to declaring methods like this  pretend the referenced methods exist and work   and calling them like this  which is beautifully self documenting and reads like English  However  in Kotlin  a similar method like this  which already starts to sound odd using a variable named   But then it gets worse when I call it  and here we see the biggest problem  One can likely guess by reading this line alone that is a rectangle in which the circle will be drawn  However  what is   It could be antialiasing  yes  but it could also be whether to draw it opaquely  or some toggle about whether to draw it at all  Anyway  I could cite more reasons why Swift and Objective C programmers love their labels with method calls  but I ve made my point  Is there any way to enable labels on method call in Kotlin 
RxJava   Backpressuring keyboard inputs  Here s a fun RxJava problem  I want to use RxJava backpressure operators to quickly lookup a typed input while each character is being typed  much like Google does on its search page  I went through the Backpressure documentation and I came up with this  I am using RxJavaFX RxKotlinFX to leverage JavaFX   This works great  If I type  Hello  against the control it will emit the  Hello  after 200 ms of no typing  But if I want this to truly be more responsive  I should actually have some sort of rolling accumulation for each keystroke input  Then my console output should really look like this  Those should be all my emissions when I type the word  Hello   and the 200ms defines how much time should elapse before the accumulation resets  How do I do this

Many small modules  or few large modules for best build performance  A few years ago  when first adopting gradle for Android  before Gradle 2 0   I found that there was some overhead to using and depending upon a module  so I ve stayed away from splitting my project into smaller modules  and instead have created very large modules  After trying out some other build systems  like Buck for instance   performance is gained by splitting your code into multiple small modules  Some of the modern programming languages like Kotlin even have visibility modifiers specifically built around the concept of splitting your code into modules  We re currently at Gradle 2 14 1  almost 3 0   and for the past several releases  they ve quoted massive performance gains  With the changes to Gradle   the Android plugin the past few years  does it now produce faster builds to split your code into smaller modules  or to use fewer large modules 
Can a covariant type parameter be in an input position in the constructor  In this answer  Michael suggests that the generic type parameter be made co variant in order to allow the creation of an empty node  I get that the generic type parameter is in all output positions since all the properties of the and its sub types are read only   s   But it does have the type parameter in an input position in the constructor  I thought that that code wouldn t work in C  so I tried it out and  to my surprise  it worked just fine  I realize now that in doing this exercise  I learnt something new about variance  So  my first question is  Are co variant type parameters allowed in input positions in constructors  In what other places are type parameters allowed to disregard their variance qualifiers  Another thing I learnt about variance is that the variant generic type parameter may not even appear in the variant interface declaration as seen in the example below  You ll see that the interface does not have in either input or output positions  This also came as a shock to me  My second question is  And the other question I have is  what is the C  equivalent of the type in Kotlin  The answer says that is the most sub type that cannot further be derived  It is the exact opposite of  or the most base type in other languages   To emulate that code in C   it didn t make sense to have this  Because that s just illegal C  code and also doesn t seem analogous to   So  I had to fake a dummy like so to imitate the class declaration  My third and final question is  Therefore  my final question is  is there a place that contains an exhaustive list of all the types available in Kotlin along with their descriptions  Because even though the Basic Types page lists most of the common ones  it seems not to be an exhaustive list  The types not listed there are all sprinkled over the documentation  Like in the instance above  they just appear with a mention on a page here or there

How to share boilerplate Kotlin configuration across multiple Gradle projects  The typical Kotlin configuration in a Gradle project is very boilerplate  and I m looking for a way of abstracting it out into an external build script so that it can be reused  I have a working solution  below   but it feels like a bit of a hack as the kotlin gradle plugin doesn t work out of the box this way  It s messy to apply any non standard plugin from an external script as you can t apply the plugin by id  i e  will result in The simple  well  usually  workaround is to apply by the fully qualified classname of the plugin  i e  which in this case throws a nice little exception indicating that the plugin probably wasn t meant to be called this way  So I managed to hack together a plugin  just a modified version of the real plugin  which forces it to find the plugin from the current buildscript  kotlin gradle This can then be applied in any project  i e    and you re up and running for Kotlin development  It works  and I haven t had any issues yet  but I m wondering if there is a better way  I m not really keen on merging in changes to the plugin every time there s a new version of Kotlin

Kotlin  How can I avoid autoboxing  garbage  in delegated properties  In my software  I have some various values which use property delegation  This is a simple similar example showing what I do  What I ve noticed  however  is that referring to this value seems to create an autoboxed object    on EVERY reference  Because the value must be referenced potentially millions or times per second  this results in massive garbage creation for my software  heavy stress is put on the garbage collector  Is there a way to avoid the overhead  If not directly  are there any clever ways to  emulate  property delegation that are performant  Submitted a bug report on YouTrack

How do I access a Java static method on a Kotlin subclass  I ve created a Kotlin subclass of a Java class  has two static methods  and calling these from within my class works just as I expect  However  I d like to call one of these methods outside of my Kotlin subclass  The Problem If I try from a different Kotlin class  I get the following compilation error  I think this is because the compiler is trying to resolve the method on  s companion object instead of finding the inherited method from its superclass  As a workaround  I can directly define a method with the same signature on   I think this has the same behavior I would have gotten had I relied on the default inherited method from a Java subclass  but I m wondering if there s a better way to do this  Is there a way to call an inherited static Java method on a Kotlin subclass

Better way to map Kotlin data objects to data objects I want to convert map some  data  class objects to similar  data  class objects  For example  classes for web form to classes for database records  I use ModelMapper for such works in Java  but it can t be used because data classes are final  ModelMapper creates CGLib proxies to read mapping definitions   We can use ModelMapper when we make these classes fields open  but we must implement features of  data  class manually   cf  ModelMapper examples   How to map such  data  objects in Kotlin  Update  ModelMapper automatically maps fields that have same name  like tel  > tel  without mapping declarations  I want to do it with data class of Kotlin  Update  The purpose of each classes depends on what kind of application  but these are probably placed in the different layer of an application  For example  data from database  Database Entity  to data for HTML form  Model View Model  REST API result to data for database These classes are similar  but are not the same  I want to avoid normal function calls for these reasons  It depends on the order of arguments  A function for a class with many fields that have same type  like String  will be broken easily  Many declarations are nesessary though most mappings can be resolved with naming convention  Of course  a library that has similar feature is intended  but information of the Kotlin feature is also welcome  like spreading in ECMAScript

Kotlin  How can I create a  static  inheritable function  For example  I want to have a function on a type that extends so that I can use the function on both  The first  obvious  way to do this is through the companion object of   but this doesn t allow for   The second way I tried was defining an extension function on   which is inconvenient because you are forced to define a companion object  It also doesn t allow for   Does anybody know how I can do this 
Can extension functions be called in a  static  way  Is it possible to create an extension function and call it as if it were static  For Example    I know that the code sample doesn t work    I understand that kotlin s extension functions are resolved statically  as mentioned in the Kotlin Reference  Extension Functions   but this does not mean they can be called as if they were static functions within a class  in a Java sense   I also understand that this code will not work because there is no instance of System to pass into the method that the compiler will generate  therefore it won t compile  Why would I want this  Some of you might be wondering why this behaviour is desirable  I can understand why you would think that is isn t  so here are some reasons  It has all of the benefits that standard extension functions give  An instance of the class doesn t need to be created just to access the extra functionality  The functions can be accessed from a system wide context  provided the class is visible   To summarise    Does Kotlin have a way to  hook  a static function onto a class  I d love to know 
What are the rules of semicolon inference in Kotlin  This is what the grammar page says  This seems to imply that there is a need to specify semicolons in some cases  but it doesn t specify them  and the grammar tree below doesn t exactly make this obvious  Also I have suspicions that there are some cases where this feature may not work correctly and cause problems  So the question is when should one insert a semicolon and what are the corner cases one needs to be aware of to avoid writing erroneous code 
Lifecycle methods in statically typed languages In the last year I ve become a mobile developer and a functional programming admirer  In each of the mobile arenas there are components with lifecycle methods that make up the meat of the app  The following will use Android and Kotlin as examples  but the same applies to iOS and Swift  In Android  there are  s with lifecycle methods like   You might also define a function    which will do exactly what the name describes  For the purposes of the question  let s say there s a variable defined in that is used in a button click handler  This is usually the case   is essentially  s setup method   The example class would look like this  Notice the declaration of as a  nullable string  and the use of  null safe call   These are required because the compiler cant guarantee that will be called before   As developers though  we know that will always be called first      My question is how can I tell the compiler about the guaranteed order of these methods and eliminate the null checking behavior    I suppose it s possible to up our and call directly  thus sidestepping the Android framework and lifecycle methods  but the compiler JVM would likely run into an error before anything interesting happened     The guarantee that is called first is provided by the Android framework  which is an external source of truth and might break function differently in the future  Seeing that all Android apps are based on this source of truth though  I believe it s safe to trust 
Reverting source code to Java after IntelliJ s Kotlin > Java conversion So I wanted to try out converting our backend API source code which is written in Java and see how it looks  IIRC there is a preview before converting   but once I did it it automatically started converting all the files in the selected folders  and in the end it asked for code corrections  which I responded with no as I wanted to cancel it and now I am stuck with a broken code base with no other options than  Reverting to the last git commit and reimplementing all the changes done from my side  I could have prevented it but committing before the conversion but oh well  Continue using Kotlin to code in but I have code errors which I don t know how to fix What I am asking instead is if there s anyway to convert Kotlin back to Java in IntelliJ IDEA  Thank you in advance

Does Kotlin provide any implementations of its collection interfaces  I see that Kotlin provides a number of interfaces for implementing collections  They are listed on this page  I do not see any implementations of these provided by Kotlin  I do  however  see that there are functions in the global namespace that help us create instances of these collections  For e g  to create a mutable list of numbers  we may say  To create a read only view of the list  we may say  Or  to create a read only list of numbers  we may say  To create a list of items and initialize each element with the value   we might say  To create an Array  say  5 elements with an initializer function for each element of the array  we may say  However  if I d like to create a without any books in it but I d simply like to initialize it like this  Java or C  code   How may I do that in Kotlin  Are there publicly exposed implementations of its collection interfaces  Do they have default constructors 
Convert a nullable type to its non nullable type  I have a bunch of beans that have nullable properties like so  And I have a method in the global space like so  And somewhere else  I need to make a from the stuff that s inside   So  I do this  Also  doing some conversion here with to cleanse it every time with every little thing  while on the one hand provides me compile time guarantees and safety it is a big bother most of the time  Is there some short hand to get around these scenarios 
What s the correct syntax for overriding an interface member function with a visibility modifier  Neither of the two pages  the one on Interfaces  nor the one on Visibility Modifiers provides an example of the syntax I am after  so I ask  I have an interface like so  And I am writing an implementation for it but neither of the three below listed syntaxes work  Each time  the compiler reports the following error

In Kotlin  how can you limit the choices in a fluent Builder for different forks of settings In Kotlin  I am writing a builder and want a series of steps that are obvious and must be completed  With a fluent builder I can present all steps but not really set the order they must occur  nor can I change which ones are available based on the previous step  So  is fine  but then adding options like SSL certs  Now nothing prevents the non ssl version from having the and other options  There should be an error when calling this SSL method without first turning on   And it might be more complicated with more forks in the road where I only want some objects present and not others  How do I limit which functions are available at each fork in the builder logic  Is this impossible for a builder  and instead should be a DSL  Note  this question is intentionally written and answered by the author  Self Answered Questions   so that the idiomatic answers to commonly asked Kotlin topics are present in SO

In Kotlin  how do I integrate a Kovenant promise with Elasticsearch async responses  I use Kovenant in my Kotlin application  and I m calling Elasticsearch which has its own async API  I would rather use promises but the best I can come up with is something like  Which makes an Kovenant async task thread  then Elasticsearch uses a thread from its pool  and then synchronously blocks Elasticsearch to get back a result  It seems silly to spawn new threads while blocking others  Is there an approach to integrate the thread dispatching more closely  Note  this question is intentionally written and answered by the author  Self Answered Questions   so that solutions for interesting problems are shared in SO

I have a Vertx request and I need to calculate an externally visible  public  URL I am using Vertx 3 with Kotlin  and at times I need to return a specific URI from the perspective of the public URL which is not the same as what the Vertx web request thinks my URL is  This is likely due to my load balancer or proxy receiving one URL  and then forwarding to my application on an internal URL  So if I do this  I end up with a URL like instead of   Everything is wrong about that URL  I found a header that supposedly tell me more about the original request such as but it only includes or sometimes it has the port but that isn t enough to figure out all parts of the URL  I end up with something like which is still not the correct public URL  I also need to handle not just my current URL  but peer URL s  like while on page  something page1  go to  something page2  on same server  The same problems mentioned about when I try to resolve to another URL because important parts of the public URL are unobtainable  Is there a method in Vertx web I m missing to determine this public URL  or some idiomatic way to solve this  I m coding in Kotlin  so any examples for that language are great  Note  this question is intentionally written and answered by the author  Self Answered Questions   so that solutions for interesting problems are shared in SO 
In Vertx I need to redirect all HTTP requests to the same URL but for HTTPS I have written a Vertx web handler in Koltin that redirects any request I receive that is HTTP to HTTPS  and I m using to determine if the request is not SSL  and this worked fine until I put my code behind a load balancer  If the load balancer talks to my Vertx web server on HTTPS then it thinks all user requests are HTTPS even if they are not  And if I change the load balancer to talk to Vertx web on HTTP then every request is redirected endlessly even if already the user is using HTTPS  Then I also see another problem  that the redirect using goes to the private address instead of the publically available address that the user is actually talking to  Is there a handler in Vertx web that I m missing that does this  or some idiomatic way to solve this  Should I just do this from JavaScript since it sees the real user address instead of trying a server side redirect  I m coding in Kotlin  so any examples for that language are great  Note  this question is intentionally written and answered by the author  Self Answered Questions   so that solutions for interesting problems are shared in SO

Is there an overhead for writing a library in Kotlin for Android  I m considering porting a Java  Android  library to Kotlin  I really like Kotlin and the benefits over Java should reduce the number of bugs in the library  Since the library is targeting a resource constrained environment I m worried that by porting the library to Kotlin there will be extra overhead  Does a Kotlin library  distributed as  class files  introduce any runtime or extra overhead versus a Java library  Will the resulting Android app be any larger or slower because of Kotlin

How to set Kotlin default property value to `this` I have following class structure which represents simple tree  Each item can have multiple children and parent  The tree root is causing me a headache though  I m trying to do this without using so I can traverse the tree upwards by calling   To simplify it I want the root to has itself as a parent  but I cannot figure out how to do it  That code doesn t compile  because it s not possible to reassign the   But using as a default parameter value is also not possible  Is there any way out  If I allow the parent to be nullable  then the solution is easy  But I don t wanna use the nulls  if possible  Also would defeat the chain

Is there a way to make BigDecimal faster than I have here  I m working on some financial analysis software that will need to process large  ish  volumes of data  I d like to use BigDecimal for the accuracy  some pricing info goes to four or five digits to the right of the decimal  but I was concerned about speed  I wrote the following test app and it appears that BigDecimal can be 90 to 100 times slower than Doubles  I knew there would be a delta  but that s more than I was expecting  Here s a typical output after many trials  Am I missing something  Here is the code  I tried to make it representative of real world  I created a constant where I could  pi  but also did some inline math of numbers that would vary from data row to data row   such as pi   BigDecimal i  + BigDecimal 1   My point being that avoiding constructors can t be the only answer  Fortunately  it appears Double has enough precision anyway since numbers will be typically in the format 00000 00000  Any hidden gotchas I should know about  though  Do people use Double for financial analysis software

Adding int and int  in Kotlin I ran into a problem  which seems so simple that everyone should have ran into it at some point or another  yet failed to find a solution anywhere  Copied from the REPL  So what I m trying to do is add together an Int and an Int  and I d like the result to be an Int  Very simple  I m of course aware of the operator  however I want to avoid using this whenever possible  as it is not change safe   I am aware of the following solution  which handles null safety and avoids the use of the operator  My question is the following  Is there a way to do addition with the use of an if else block and or a when block  which does not require the use of the operator  My reason for preferring the use of if else and not the Elvis operator is intelligibility for people from languages without an Elvis operator  So I d like to get as close to as possible  Thank you  if my problem or motivation is unclear or contrary to the design or intent of Kotlin  please let me know    Sure  I may be able to assert that some variable is safe at the time when it s added  but this assertion will remain there even as code around it changes  possibly making the assertion invalid  thus negating one of Kotlin s points  null safety

How to write a reusable transform for String to Enum value across a group of Enum classes   Kotlin  I have a group >5 of Enum classes that take String parameter in its values  and I want to have simple code for all these Enum classes to convert from a String field in JSON object  I want to be able to write code like this I am having a hard time figuring out if IJsonStringConvertible can work  and what its definition would be  and how to implement it in the Enum value instances  Any advice  Update  I have now written the converter as this  Is this the best way  Can I also express that the return value is a subtype of the parameter so don t need to cast return value 
Kotlin way of filtering max values from 2 arrays  I currently have 2 arrays  both containing 5 objects  All objects contain variables  Sample data  What I m trying to do is create a function which will filter these arrays on the maximum values  Now I know Kotlin has a method on their array called which will return the maximum value of the array it is used on  This made me wonder  currently I m using nested for loop just like someone would in Java    is there a visually beautiful faster better way of doing so in Kotlin  Expected output using sample data

RxJava Schedulers immediate   behavior while Unit Testing I am trying to write test for my DAO object that uses reactive interface  I have a table with recipes and I want to test that when I insert data to this table  the subscriber receives list with recipes  I am using TestSubscriber class and performing asserts on that class  My simple test look like this  The problem is that assertion fails because no item was emitted  But when I insert this line above   the test is successful  My observable does not emit terminal event and therefore the timeout is performed  but in the meantime of waiting  the onNext was called with list of recipes  My getRecipes method  How is that possible  I thought that when I use Schedulers immediate    the operation will be performed on the same thread and my TestSubscriber receives the events  If not  how should I write this test so it succeeds  I want to test that onNext is called and I don t want to insert artificial sleep commands between 
Android Kotlin Moshi Custom Json Adapter Ok so i have the following Json Pojo  And i want to write a customs deserialiser  so the final object will look like this  Basically  the mappings are  based on some value inside JProduct The JCategory two lists will be joint into 1  in which will contain more JCategory plus Prod1 Prod2  Is this a valid and efficient way of mapping the data in this adapter according to Moshi  Notice that i have a JCategory and inside a list of the same object  so i thought the Adapter would parse this automatically but it doesn t  So i tried and it worked  So my questions are  is the proper way of handling cases like this  how can i map an object to another one other based on some property inside it  The fromJson can only return 1 type of transformed object

React to retrofit call I have an app that has a viewpager with 4 fragments  I want to populate all the fragments with data from my server  I load the data in the activity and I want to distribute it to all the fragments  So I have this signature  And I call the method and populate a List  And then I have a method to get a Observable from this list  And I get then in my fragments  Well    this should work  but It doesn t  It happens that the first of my fragments gets empty while the forth have data   second and third are not supposed to have any data    and they don t  So I think  When the fragment gets created  the list is still empty  so the Observable in the activity has nothing to provide    But when the view pager get s in the forth fragment  the List is not null anymore  so my screen shows the data  My problem is  How do I make the Observable in the activity keep pushing the data into the fragments  Right now  it only push data when the Observable is subscriped    I want to change this  so it pushes when there is new data   I think that the first Observable should comunicate directly with the Subject  bit I m not sure how to do that     Any help is appreciated

JUnit   ControllerAdvice and lack of checked exceptions in Kotlin I wrote a validation advisor in Kotlin which throws when validation fails  I have a JUnit test  I write some parts in Kotlin and some in Java  to learn Kotlin in existing private project  which checks if exception is thrown  But then I saw that test fails because it throws UndeclaredThrowableException instead of   Next  I read that Kotlin does not have checked exception  I think not only me have this problem   I am pretty sure that way of handling exceptions with  ControllerAdvice in Spring and Java also may be problematic when we decide to switch to Kotlin in production projects   because it rely on class which is thrown  and throwing take away from us this possibility  Is there a way to by pass this behaviour  to make sure that is possible to switch to Kotlin and old Spring way of handling exceptions  and unit tests for   will remain unchanged  Thank you in advance for any help  P S  Github repo for project is available here  Playgroud for Kotlin  Spring Data etc   P S 2 Stacktrace  at org springframework test context junit4 SpringJUnit4ClassRunner run SpringJUnit4ClassRunner java 191     at org junit runner JUnitCore run JUnitCore java 137     at com intellij junit4 JUnit4IdeaTestRunner startRunnerWithArgs JUnit4IdeaTestRunner java 68     at com intellij rt execution junit IdeaTestRunner$Repeater startRunnerWithArgs IdeaTestRunner java 51     at com intellij rt execution junit JUnitStarter prepareStreamsAndStart JUnitStarter java 237     at com intellij rt execution junit JUnitStarter main JUnitStarter java 70     at sun reflect NativeMethodAccessorImpl invoke0 Native Method     at sun reflect NativeMethodAccessorImpl invoke NativeMethodAccessorImpl java 62     at sun reflect DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl invoke DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl java 43     at java lang reflect Method invoke Method java 497     at com intellij rt execution application AppMain main AppMain java 147 Caused by  java lang reflect UndeclaredThrowableException    at com sun proxy $Proxy65 save Unknown Source     at ActorValidationTest test WhenNameIsNotPresent ThenExceptionIsThrown ActorValidationTest java 26     at sun reflect NativeMethodAccessorImpl invoke0 Native Method     at sun reflect NativeMethodAccessorImpl invoke NativeMethodAccessorImpl java 62     at sun reflect DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl invoke DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl java 43     at java lang reflect Method invoke Method java 497     at org junit runners model FrameworkMethod$1 runReflectiveCall FrameworkMethod java 50     at org junit internal runners model ReflectiveCallable run ReflectiveCallable java 12     at org junit runners model FrameworkMethod invokeExplosively FrameworkMethod java 47     at
Why doesn t rearrange code work in Kotlin files in Intellij  I love Jetbrain s Idea IDE and its ergonomics  One of my favorite tools is idea s rearrange code  action  you can bring it up by hitting    It rearranges the code in the java file to put methods in alphabetical order and order the fields in an organized fashion that the user defines  For whatever reason  it doesn t work with Jetbrain s own language  kotlin     This sucks even more with the fact that kotlin quickfixes the fields right above the method instead of the beginning of the file like most java files  When is Idea going to support rearrange code for kotlin files 
kotlin unreachable code when using finally and enum I ve encoutered such issue  that android studio warns me about unreachable code  I don t understand  how it is unreachable  My original code  If I change finally to   there s no warning  If I combine all of them  the warning appears again  Is this a Kotlin bug  or am I missing something  EDIT  Basket provider is simple enum class 
Kotlin   nonnull getter for a nullable field I m new with Kotlin and I try to rework a small Java project to this new language  I use mongodb in my project and I have a class  for example  I have to mark field as nullable    because of empty constructor  When I try to access this field from another class I have to use non null check    But the logic of my application is that field is never null  mongo creates an instance of Player and immediately sets id field   And I don t want to make a non null check everywhere  I tried to make a non null getter  but it does not compile  I can also make some stub for id and use it in constructor  but this looks like a dirty hack  So is there a workaround to solve the issue 
How to propagate default arguments between functions in Kotlin  Kotlin has default arguments for function and constructor parameters  Now  I have a function and I want to call it from different places but also retain the possibility to not pass on of the arguments and instead use the default value  I know  I can declare the default arguments in the calling functions but now my default parameter in is pointless as it s always overwriten and I have duplicated the default arguments in all calling functions  That s not very DRY  Is there a better way to propagate the default arguments

Capturing objects with JMockit and Kotlin I am using JMockit for quite some time already  and I really like it  However  I just ran into an issue I cannot seem to solve  See the snippet below for some Kotlin test code  testing Kotlin production code  When I run my test I get the following error  I am 100  sure my production code exercises the storage correctly  because when I replace the capture like below  my test succeeds  Does anyone have experience capturing parameters in Kotlin with JMockit  1 28   What am I doing wrong  I guess it has to do with the block  since in Java you would use static space   
Kotlin Modules with Gradle Multi Project Kotlin got rid of package level visibility for module level visibility  I think that was a great idea  except it s difficult to get multiple Kotlin modules working in a Gradle multi project setup  I m using Gradle Wrapper 3 1  with Android Studio 2 2 and Kotlin 1 0 4 Here is my structure  Project     myapp  android application      lib  android library      commons  android library  When I try to sync or build I get the following error  The only thing that has worked is to make sure that the module names have a lexical order that matches the order they need to be built in  which is ridiculous  and not a proper solution  I know I can publish and as artifacts  but I d really prefer to not do that  Anyone have any suggestions

Cancel superseded task in ThreadPool in Java Kotlin I m trying to figure out how to cancel a task in a if a new tasks comes along that supersedes it  I have some classes similar to this  However  if the same gets submitted to  a change was made and needs to be saved to disk   I would like to be able to able to cancel the of the previous submission  since it s now out of date and will be overwritten  there s no reason to wait for it to finish anymore   The problem is  the locking is taking place inside the future that doesn t exist yet  I know you re never supposed to force kill a locked thread  I don t even know how since it s a    so what is the proper way to do this  Edit  My question is different from this one as I don t have access to the future to cancel it  the lock isn t put in place till the picks it up  and by that point the could have been submitted multiple times  and I don t know which would own the lock   If I did it would be a piece of cake  the code to handle interruption is already in place   How should I change my code to get a reference to the future  or even the thread  that owns the lock

How to cycle a list infinitely and lazily in Kotlin  I have a list of and want to find the next direction when I take a right or left turn  Here is the working code I have  However  this would be so much simpler and easier to read if I could take the list and cycle through it infinitely  and lazily   In Clojure  I can do that  using clojure core cycle  Another thing that would help is if I could look up in a list using a negative index  like in Ruby or Python   Negative index to Python list Question  Can I do through a list collection in Kotlin  Is there an idiomatic way to do a negative index lookup in Kotlin 
Why doesn t spring data elasticsearch use the objectmapper from the spring context I am developing an application that uses spring data elasticsearch for the data storage  I am also writing this application using kotlin  This has some special quirks  one being that jackson needs the jackson module kotlin  to get rid of the problems with no args constructor   I also use the jackson datatype jsr310 module  Spring boot is nice enough to pick these modules up from the classpath and register them automatically  I also have the write dates as timestamps option set to false  However spring data elasticsearch seems to be oblivious to it  I figured that it is because the DefaultEntityMapper news an objectmapper and doesn t use the one from the spring context  I was wondering why  I fixed it by providing some extra configuration that makes sure that spring data elasticsearch uses the objectmapper that i get from the spring context  Is there a better easier way to make sure spring data elasticsearch uses the objectmapper from the context

How to explicitly invoke an object s init block  I have a class that looks something like the following  On line 7  I would like to invoke the block directly  however this does not seem to be possible without using reflection  But I need to have the block in order to initialize the properties without instantiating  so if I replace the code inside the block with   then the compiler will complain that   Property must be initialized or be abstract   How do I avoid duplicating all the stuff inside

Android client and java server in the same git project I am developing a simple Android application and it should communicate with server using REST api  Both client and server use kotlin and serialize classes to json with Jackson and API looks like  Client and server have their own git repositories and I use Android Studio and Idea to work with them separately  This leads to class declaration duplication as they both need to know API  What s the best way to get rid of duplication  I could move API to some third project and then build   publish   add dependency on it but that s a lot of work during development  Is it a good idea to move them to the single project so it will look the way  Thanks
Android Espresso tests  written in Kotlin  cannot see main classes and packages I have an issue with Kotlin Espresso tests  I have applied Gradle plugin in the module s build script  and the tests run without issues in Android Studio  the test class is annotated and run by runner   but running the Gradle task  assembleDebugAndroidTest  from terminal fails to find my main classes and packages  classes used in the tests   It throws an error  Here is the sourceSets section of the build script  And test dependencies in the module  Project s build script  I m using version 1 0 5 2 of Kotlin  We have a custom test runner as which registers some idling resources and some activity hook for unlocking device screen and acquiring the wake lock  and uses TestButler for disabling animations and stabilizing tests  However  the tests are annotated with Espresso jUnit 4 runner     But the fact that Android Studio runs the tests without any issues is confusing

Best way to use BufferedReader in Kotlin So I ve just started using Kotlin for Android  in hopes that it might help me with Swift as well   and converted my Android Java codes into Kotlin  In one of the conversions  I stumbled upon a BufferedReader  which I would usually write in Java  or rather C   as the following  But in Kotlin  it seems that Kotlin doesn t allow me to assign values to variables in while conditions  Currently  I ve written the code as the following  which I don t find so elegant  and prev gen  despite using Kotlin   What would be the best way to use BufferedReader in Kotlin

Accessing views from the Activity with Anko I know I can use an attribute with Anko to identify a view  Then obtain it in the using the function  or by using Kotlin Android Extensions   But I feel like I am missing something  the only place the README mentions the function or Kotlin Android Extensions is in the section titled Supporting Existing Code  Which makes it seem like the function is only meant for supporting  old  XML code  So my question is this  is using an along with the function the correct way of accessing a from the using Anko  Is there a more  Anko  way of handling this  Or am I missing some other benefit of Anko that makes accessing the from the irrelevant  And a second related question  if this is the correct way of accessing a from the   is there a way of creating an resource  i e    from within an   Rather than creating each in the file 
What s the intended use of  JvmSynthetic in Kotlin  I have come across the annotation in kotlin stdlib  and I m wondering what it is for  but  unfortunately  it is undocumented  As far as I understand  applying it to a program element will add the modifier to the corresponding bytecode elements  As a consequence  the element becomes invisible from Java  Somewhere in Java code  But the same elements are still visible in Kotlin code  Is hiding declarations from non Kotlin sources a valid use of   Is it the intended use  What are the other appropriate use cases  Since hides functions from Java  they cannot be overridden in Java either  and when it comes to an member  the calls then result into    Given that  can I use to prohibit overriding members of a Kotlin class in Java sources 
Public fields for Java compatibility I found recent interest in Kotlin as a language  because the platform we develop for is Java 6 based and hence lacks any syntactic sugar the recent years brought to Java  There s but one thing that makes it impossible to use Kotlin over Java in development  that is  the platform we develop for uses some reflection internally and requires members to be public  It won t work otherwise  So  the bytecode generated from the Kotlin file in fact produces public getters and setters  the fields themselves yet remain private  Is there a way to overcome this  so I get real public fields  I am aware of the design failure that requires public fields  but the system is kind of a black box to us  we cannot change the fact that it has to be this way

Smartcast is impossible because propery has open or custom getter I am learning Kotlin  My code is as follows  method  As written in documentation  kotlin automatically casts to type after checking with is operator  So  I expected that it would work  But instead it bothers me with compilation error saying   Smartcast to is impossible because is a propery that has open or custom getter  I thought maybe error is because activity can be nullable so I tried  But it didn t work and compilation failed with same error  However  following code works fine  Its okay but above error doesn t seem to explain anything about why smartcast fails  I am not a Kotlin expert  I m just a beginner learning Kotlin  I found no documentation anywhere  These kind of error descriptions makes Kotlin horrible to learn  Can anyone explain in simple terms

How to compare a Class< > against a Java boxed primitive type without kotlin compiler warnings I m using Kotlin to write something that works with Java s reflection APIs  My input is a and I need to decide whether that type is a double or integer  but I need to support both primitives and the boxed nullable types that Java uses  This toy example does what I m trying to do  But  this approach generates the following warnings from the Kotlin compiler  However  is a syntax error  the approaches suggested on an earlier question require a instead of a  and the extension method crashes on some of my inputs   What s the correct Kotlin way to perform this kind of check  Edit  Further investigation  prompted by  voddan s answer  has revealed that this problem is a symptom of a more general bit of weirdness in Kotlin s type reflection  So it seems not all s are created equal  I ve played with casts and aux variables and the results seem highly consistent

projections are not allowed for immediate subtypes of a supertype I have an abstract class like the following  I want another abstract class that inherits from this  The CascadedSync class should not modify the generic parameter C  it should  in fact  only implement a single method of ISync and nothing else  I am trying out different syntaxes to achive this seemingly simple task  In Java  this would look just like this  Translating it to Kotlin with the help of IntelliJ produces this  But at the same time gives the following error  projections are not allowed for immediate subtypes of a supertype What is the right syntax 
Match response handler with request in VertX Let s say I have a Load Balancer  LB  in front of 1  n VertX  V  instances  each VertX instance is connected to a queue  Q   and I have 1  m Backends  BE   A user clicks on a button which makes a post request or even opens a web socket  the load balancer forwards the request to one of the VertX instances  which fires a request to the queue  one of the Backends consumes the message and sends a response back  if the correct VertX instance consumes it  it can lookup the response handler and write a response to the user  if the wrong VertX instance consumes it  there won t be a response handler to write a response to and the user will wait indefinitely for a response  See this sketch  Alternatively  V2 dies and the load balancer reconnects the user to V1 which means even if I could send it back to the exact same one that made the request  it s not guaranteed to still be there once the response comes back  but the user might still be there awaiting a response via another VertX instance  What I m currently doing is to generate a GUID for each new connection  then as soon as the websocket connects  store the websocket handler inside a hashmap against the GUID and then when the BE wants to respond  it does a fanout to all 1  n VertX instances  the one that currently has the correct GUID in its hashmap can then write a response to the user  Same for handling POST   GET in this manner  Pseudocode  This does however mean that if I have a 1000 VertX applications running  that the backend will need to fanout its message to a 1000 frontend instances of which only one will make use of the message  VertX seems like it already takes care of async operations very well  is there a way in VertX to identify each websocket connection instead of having to maintain a map of GUIDs mapped to websocket handlers   post handlers  Also  referring to the picture  is there a way for V3 to consume the message  but still be able to write a response back to the websocket handler that s currently connected to V2

Why don t property initializers call a custom setter  From the Kotlin documentation  custom setters are allowed  But you cannot have a custom setter without a custom getter  and initialize from the block   Although you can have a custom getter without a custom setter  no problem here  So why can t you use a custom setter with a property initialized from within the block  and why does the block invoke the custom setter while the property initializer assigns directly  bypassing the custom setter

Kotlin   possibly incorrectly reporting an unused code I have a base class for all activities in my app  I want a variable to be of type   This is how I declared the variable in Kotlin  The problem is that in Android studio I get the part    grayed out and the popup message says   No cast needed  If I follow the AS advice and I remove the casting  I get compiler errors when I am trying to assign the variable using other activities deriving from BaseActivity  The following code  gives me an error  Type inference failed  Expected type mismatch  required   found    This causes problems mainly when I am committing code changes because the options  Cleanup  and  Optimize imports  in AS commit wizard are checked  which removes  unused  code  the  as Class  part   which is in fact actually used  The solution is not to turn these options off because I actually want them to be set to true  If I commit my changes  go to the class where the casting is used and undo the changes  it asks me  Undo Optimize Imports before commit    If I confirm  I get the casting back  so I know this is causing the issue  PS  I use Kotlin 1 0 5 3

Kotlin   Usefulness of  computed  var properties  I noticed that when I have a property with a custom   that does not use the identifier  a backing field is generated anyway  I checked the bytecode  and the documentation says so as well  Consider a class like this  Since it s a property  a default  and therefore a backing field  will be generated  However  the will always print  green   no matter what I set to  The backing field will be set to  blue  anyway  Since there is no way to access it outside the accessor methods  or via reflection  I really can t think of a reason for this  Am I missing something here  Maybe a usecase or another way of accessing the backing field  Or is it just a bug  or a missing warning in IntelliJ

Kotlin visibility of nested members I have a class with a nested  private class  I have a   standard Java builder pattern  that constructs instances of this class  I don t want anyone outside of my class to be able to see my hidden class  In Java I could do this  But I can t figure out how to do the same in Kotlin  Note that for the sake of Java interop I want to keep my builder  I also want it because my object is complicated to construct and I want it to be immutable so I have a builder with lots of setters  adders  vals  etc  and then in I construct a single immutable   The only alternatives I see are  Instead of have a in my builder save all the info necessary to construct one and then construct it in   Works but adds a ton of complexity  Give up on being immutable and allow the builder to call into it to set up a Expose the Is there no way to mimic the Java version

Kotlin generics inheritance   Type mismatch I am trying to build a set of providers for realm objects  Here is an example structure I ve tried to build  Interface  Base provider class with companion function for typed provider instantiation  And here is a child class  Problem I have is on the line I can t figure out why it does not see that E is actually SomeChildProvider  Thank you  P S  I know that I can cast it to E  but in my opinion  it should not be needed in this situation  Maybe I am missing something obvious here or probably lack of Kotlin knowledge  UPDATE1  After the first answer  we have realized that code above does not make much sense since we have to define a type of returning provider and to pass it into create method  Initial idea was that create method returns some type which is BaseProvider subtype  Here are the changes I have made in order to support the initial idea  IDataProvider BaseProvider ChildProvider UI call Although  createModel method returns RealmObject  it s instance will be of ChildRealmModel  What I don t like about it is that we have to inspect instance type and cast into if we need exact model somewhere else

Kotlin  What are named lambda arguments used for  In Kotlin  it is possible to give lambda arguments names in their definition  As you can see  and are named in the lambda  I thought this might be really useful information for an IDE  to generate lambdas with the parameter names filled in   but at least with IntelliJ the functionality either doesn t exist or works in a way I m unaware  So  what are the uses of named lambda arguments  Do they change the compile output in some way  And are there any tricks you can use them for

Kotlin werid compile error related to generics and auto type cast I think this code snippet should compile  Here is a convenient reference to Google Guava s Invokable  Brief definition is given  The above code should compile all fine but compiler yields 3 weird message  here is the log output  after proper normalization   The solution is simple  assign this to a variable and use that local variable  No manual type cast or other bothering stuff and it will compile  But I m interested if this is a bug of kotlin compiler or I m missing some info about kotlin generics EDIT  Working code  This has been submitted to JetBrains but they didn t respond yet  so I will keep this open until they verified or someone come up scolding my stupidness

Converting Android project with databinding from Java to Kotlin I have a large Android project written in Java and am currently converting it to Kotlin  Many of my activites and fragments use databinding  Initially  when I converted my first activity using databinding to Kotlin  the project was unable to build for this activity  The error said there were missing references to the databinding library  I added  to dependencies in and also to the same file  After building  the Kotlin activity with databinding worked  whereas all the remaining Java databinding activites now report that the databinding package reference does not exist  This leaves me in a tough spot  I was planning on converting the activities and fragments one by one to Kotlin and building them as I go  but this seems not doable at the moment since I have to make a choice between Java or Kotlin working at every build  I found Kotterknife     which is a view injection library for Kotlin  but I still cannot believe that there is no way to slowly convert your activities from Java to Kotlin  even if they do use databinding  It simply does not seem credible to me  Has anyone done converted a project in such a way in the past and succeeded without having to make a choice one or the other  Is there a way to convert single activities as you go along  The other option is to just convert all the Java to Kotlin in one go and then make one single build after it s all done  but that seems a bit risky if you put in all the work and then realize you overlooked something  Any ideas  Thanks in advance

Change Observable from AutoCompleteTextView to EditText I am trying to edit some preexisting code using Kotlin and RxJava to have a much better UI layout that how it is presented now to the user  The initial ui used AutoCompleteTextEdit to present the user Google Places results as the user types  I am trying to change it so as the user types  the results display in a ListView under the input fields instead of attached to the input fields  The issue I have is  I can only get the data to display in the listview if I leave the current code so that it ALSO displays in the AutoCompleteTextView due to the way the code is written for the observable and the custom RxFilterableArrayAdapter  With this code  the search works  but displays borth in the drop down menu  as well as the listview   see below  I want to change starting location and destination address to EditText but still have them observing correctly with the filterfeeder  and just have the results displayed only in tripPlanningResults  I just can t seem to get it working correct in terms of the adapters  How do I get EditText to subscribe to an Observable like AutoCompleteTextView does

How to solve this null check in initializer safely  I m writing a test case which I need some private properties  Since those private data are generated from a private method  I decided to use reflection to retrieve them after calculation is done  Later I remembered the delegated properties and decide to write a general delegate  Here is the code I got so far  As you can see  property is initialized by calls  and  if is set  subsequent calls will use that cache instead of keeping calling expensive reflection  The very unfortunate thing is that at  a  compiler complains because T may be a nullable type and late init mechanism will be broken  but if I initialize it with and it still complains because T may be a non null type and null safety is broken  Currently  I made this to work by initializing it with the return value of a null returning Java function  I inspected the bytecode generated and found kotlin compiler placed no null checks for that so it will work for now  but I m worried that a future kotlin version will have such checks and ruin this trick  How I m supposed to overcome this  Now I m using this  below code is released to public domain  Mention this page if you like  or do nothing  KTHacks java ReflectBackedProperty kt

Kotlin compiler s type inference can t choose which method to call  ambiguity with generic types  So  I have some Java methods with these signatures  removed annotations and code body for the sake of simplicity   And I have some code in Kotlin  which calls the  join  method  So far so good  it will spread the varargs and call the former method signature  Okie dokie  The problem comes if  for example  I want to call the latter method signature  with a  separator  argument  This code won t compile  The compiler can t get to decide which method to call  The error  I can t even name the arguments because Kotlin doesn t let argument naming for non Kotlin functions  EDIT  Replaced the E generic type parameter with plain String references in the Java method headers  and it worked  So I guess this to be an incompatibility of type inference with generic types or something like that  I m pretty sure this has to be something with the spread operator      But I can t pass the varargs parameter to the function if I don t use it  How can I solve this without touching the Java code  YES  I KNOW that there is Array joinToString extension function  but this would solve only this particular case  I need to know a generic solution

questions about DI  ViewModel etc I have the following code  I have two questions for this example  1  If i change the value and close the window without a commit  User can do this with help  X  button  then only ViewModel will store changes  and it will be displayed in GUI even after the re opening    but model POJO object will keep the old data  if I used instance of Example class  without DI  then this instance received all the changes at once  For example i don t want commit rollback functionality but i want DI and immediate updating  What i should do   ofcource i can call  commit  for  textfield change value event   2  ViewModel has constructor with parameter and if i try open ExampleView like this then I got an an obvious RuntimeException  Can I avoid this for example  by a compiler warnings  or by something else  
Circular Dependency  Voronoi Halfedge  I know   circular dependency is a bad design   but I think in this case it s warranted  When building a voronoi diagram  the cells are divided into what are called  half edges   this allows you to traverse the diagram in handy ways  Anyway  in order to instantiate a halfedge  I have to specify the mirror  or twin of the halfedge  This is funky in any language  but in Kotlin it s even more annoying because I have to use a nullable var instead of a val  like I would prefer  Right now I m doing this funkiness  which I don t like    elsewhere A halfedge mirror can never be null  and should be immutable  but I don t see how to communicate that intention in my code

Java annotation processor   Annotated Kotlin classes unit tests I have an annotation processor library that I would like to get working for Kotlin  however I have hit a snag in terms of my unit testing  I would really appreciate if someone could give me some advice  My current unit testing implementation uses Google s compile testing library  I create input and output classes and store them in the resources directory  Then during the unit test  the compile testing library compiles the input java class  executes the annotation processor and then compares the generated classes against the expected output class from the resources directory  Here is an example  from my project  of what I am referring to  Unit test class Resources  Input and expected output classes This is working great for all my current java based unit tests  However when I attempt to write some tests using Kotlin classes  my test fails to load the class  I believe this is due to the compile testing library being first and foremost a Java specific library  I don t see any mention of Kotlin on their project  At the moment I get the following issue  The problem is fairly obvious that the incorrect compiler is being used  The exception itself is thrown when my file extension is not   java   If I attempt to load a Kotlin class with the   java  file extension  it doesn t work since it is not correct Java syntax  Has anyone come across this issue before and solved it  I have had a look at a few other annotation processors  such as DBFlow   and they do not write unit tests in this manner  Since Kotlin is only recently dabbling in annotation processing  perhaps I am the first to have this problem 
Annotating generated Java source nullability  for Kotlin  I am generating Java source files for my project using a source generation tool  antlr   However  I am writing most  if not all of my code  in Kotlin  Kotlin already offers great Java interop  so using the generated sources is not a problem  However  because of how Kotlin brings Java s nullable types into a null safe system  I lose most of the null safety that I use Kotlin for  At the very best I have warnings of platform types  make type explicit to avoid subtle bugs   at the worst I have unexpected crashes and subtle bugs  Kotlin does  however  respect nullability annotations  such as JSR 305  FindBugs  Lombok  Eclipse  and JetBrains s respective forms of    bringing those in as the appropriate non null type or optional  Because the code is generated and I have access to the source  and understand how it works   I know which functions can not return   and want to annotate them as such so they include neatly into my null safe code  However  I cannot add annotations directly into the code  as it is generated during the build step and would overwrite any manual changes  Is it possible to   what is the best way to annotate the nullability of generated java sources for the purpose of use in null safe code

RxJava Observable to Completable  how to avoid toBlocking   I am currently using RxJava on Android with Kotlin  but I have a problem and I can t solve without using toBlocking    I have method in employee service which returns an Observable>  This is all and good since this Observable emits the new list of employees whenever an employee changes  But I d like to generate a PDF file from the employees  which obviously doesn t need to run everytime an employee changes  Also  I d like to return a object from my PDF generator method  I want to add a header to my PDF  and then iterate through the employees and calculate the wage of each employee  which also returns an Observable  and this is the place where I am using toBlocking right now  My current approach is this  Is there any way to make this code a little cleaner using RxJava  Thanks in advance

IntelliJ imports Java Boolean and then throws error  First of all  yes  Minecraft plugin development  Live with it  So  I m developing Kotlin in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate  but it really hates me when it comes to importing instead of automagically  My Kotlin plugin is fully up to date  and so is IntelliJ according to JB Toolbox  Every time I press to auto format and auto import it imports and then throws errors all over in the file that I should use   Indeed  it s as simple as removing the import  but that s extra effort for nothing  as it should be able to do this itself  It may have something to do with extending a Java class  which has methods returning a Java Boolean  but I don t see how this would be the case  as it s simply way too annoying and more users should have noted it before  If I change the return type to it says the overridden class  with no connection whatsoever to Kotlin STD Lib  uses the Kotlin version and that I should change it to   This has annoyed me a while now  so do anyone have any idea  The file in question is by the way this

Big compilation time for Kotlin code in IntelliJ I have used Kotlin with latest version of Eclipse for 2 months without any performance problem on my Windows 10 computer  Now I would like to do a live coding session about Kotlin with intelliJ  since it s the JetBrains language     ultimate edition that I just installed and never used before  on a recent OSX computer  The two computers have good hardware and are no limiting my tests  My problem is that each time there is a modification in my Kotlin code  the compilation time is between 8 seconds and 35 seconds  I did my tests on minimalist code  If I change the variable  a  and so need to build again  it always need 8 seconds in the best cases to complete the compilation  Since I want to do a live coding session with a lot of small functions and compilations  this kind of delay is way too much significative  The viewers will need to wait a lot before to see the results at each compilation  they are logically expecting good performance from IntelliJ tool  In the same project  I tried to do the same kind of Java class  with a single attribute  and modify its attribute in order to trigger the compilation  and it takes less than 1 second to compile  I tried to manually compile the code in command line with that  I had some decent compilation times  even if it was near to 3 seconds  When I look at the  Messages  screen in IntelliJ while it is compiling Kotlin code  I can see this  It stops here for all the compilation time  and then do almost instantaneously the next steps  Maybe there is a problem in the configuration of IntelliJ or something like this  I had a hard time at searching for something that could improve the performances but nothing helped me    I would be very grateful if someone can help me to have some realistic compilation time with Kotlin in Intellij like in Eclipse

Kotlin s synthetic properties conflict I m new on Kotlin  Among other very interesting things  I ve found the Android extensions which  according to the documentation  should let me use activities  views without the need of   Actually it works very well by adding just this line in my imports  The problem is when two different layouts contain a widget with the same id  i e  the same name for the synthetic property   e g  two different s with the id   Say the first one is on an activity and the second one belongs to the layout used inside of an adapter  When I try to call a method on the first TextView  the activity s one  I can t see the expected result  as if the call would be done on another view  As confirmation of this  when I call   I see the parent and the siblings of the other rather than the ones expected  Am I doing something wrong  The only ways I ve found to bypass this issue is to use different names in all my layouts or continue to use   but it would be a pity to waste this language feature   
Spring Boot Application  File System Watcher for Many Paths I m working on a Spring Boot application in Kotlin  One of the requirements is to load a list of paths from a database and monitor those files for changes  These paths may be individual files  folder  or both  The real issue will be the volume as this may require watching quite a few paths in disparate locations  1 000 s     The files will be local paths  though I suppose it would be possible to map mount a network file system  but not supported   so that may help things  I ve been looking at the FileSystemWatcher in Spring Boot as well as the WatchService in Java  but they seem to be more focused on watching a single directory  with an optional filter   Is there any better solution in both ease of adding many paths to a single watch event handler and performance across many watches  If not  which would be my best bet  I m also thinking about pulling this out as a micro service  so Spring Boot is not necessarily required  just an easy option  Mostly the requirement is just that it is written in Kotlin  though I could get away with some other JVM language if it will reduce the work   Thanks

Algorithm for alignment guidelines snapping found in GUI builders I try to implement a behavior that is similar to many GUI builders  Currently dragged components should snap in alignment with another component if they are almost on a horizontal or vertical line with it  My current approach is to iterate over all placed components and check if any of the four edges are  almost  aligned with an edge of the dragged component  with But this seems inefficient because this is called in onTouch  so this loop is run pretty often  Is there a better approach  General or Java answers are welcome

Inline function cannot access non public API   PublishedApi vs  Suppress vs  JvmSynthetic In Kotlin  when I have a non public member and an that calls it  there s a compilation error saying  I found several ways to call my function inside a public   but which is the best way to do it  Suppose I have a   Then the options I found are  Just make it public  This is the baseline solution  but if the others turn out to have major disadvantages  this can end up the best one  Introduced in Kotlin 1 1 M04  the annotation can be applied to an internal member  making it effectively public  The implication I noticed is that any library user will still be able to call it from Java code  that s what I don t like about it  Found in the stdlib sources  this annotation seems to suppress the error when applied to the calling function  But what are its limitations  Can it only be used for functions  Will the resulting program fail under some circumstances  I tried to call a non inline function from an inline one with this trick  and it worked  but it looks suspicious  Combine the second solution with the synthetic flag in the bytecode  I m not sure if this is a correct usage of   but this appears to hide the function from Java code  which solves the problem of the   So  which of these solutions is the best way call a non public function from a public inline one  What are the downsides of each solution that I don t see

Realm returning stale data I don t have a lot of experience writing Android apps  For fun I am writing an app that will upload my call logs to my server  This entire app is running as a Service  The Service  starts when the phone is booted  is the one that registers the ContentObserver  which then calls my custom class  I use to listen for content change events  Unfortunately  the ContentObserver is called multiple times when I e g  dial a number  For that reason  I have function that I call after a successful upload  I use Retrofit  called   This function creates a called  which is different from my regular model   This simply has one identifier which is the of the call  which should be unique enough  Then  when I am iterating through the list of all the call logs  I check every single call log against a function  which does a Realm query and checks to see if there is already a call log with that dateTime stored in the database  realm   In theory  it should work  However  I have noticed that it does not always work  It seems that very often my data is stale  When I do   it returns false  although I swear it returned true once   In my function  even when I do a on the Realm  I do not see all of my data   but the data definitely did hit the function  Here s my code   it s in Kotlin but should be easy to understand  I am very new to Realm and fairly new to Android development  so I would appreciate any help you can give me  Thanks

Adding secondary constructor to parent unexpectedly affects child classes I have a  seemingly  odd problem  It can be reproduced with just a few lines  It compiles and works as expected as long as I keep  s secondary constructor commented out  Once I put it back in  this lint error pops up where the  s parent constuctor is called  The error goes away if any of these is true  I specify variance as   My secondary constructor is empty  is declared as instead of  which I don t do because for my purposes I need it to implement    To be honest  it doesn t make much sense to me  Why does it happen only if I add non empty secondary constructor to the parent class  What does it have to do with anything  And how exactly do these  fixes  fix it  Thanks

Configurable factory in Kotlin for JavaScript I have a Kolin class A whose property is either supplied in a primary constructor  or is created by a factory in the secondary constructor of A  When I compile this code to JavaScript  Kolin Compiler version 1 0 6 release 127  and run it in a browser  Safari 10 0 3   I get the following runtime error  The error occurs in the secondary constructor of A  It seems that Kolin has a problem in performing the null check of a parameter in the secondary constructor  The code runs correctly when I change the factory declaration to  not null  and remove the factory initialization from the main   method  But this is not what I want  since I want to be able to configure the factory at application startup time  Do I miss something  or is this a bug in Kotlin s JavaScript compiler  Does anybody know a workaround for this problem  Is there another or better way to design configurable factories in Kotlin for JavaScript  Generated JavaScript code

Why Netbeans complains about ambiguity while Intellij instead doesn t I have a kotlin math lib with the following class and primary constructor  Then has also  among several secondary constructors  one which is supposed to intercept all the other number types  Everything under Idea compiles and runs  I tested the artifact with a separate java project  The same artifact doesn t run in a java project if I switch IDE  Netbeans complains about ambiguity between the two  Why  Edit  from some further analysis  it turned out Netbeans complains because one of coordinate was   the other   Trying the same on Idea  it says  So  why calling a costructor with or is fine  but doesn t resolved to the secondary constructor and provoke ambiguity

How can I explicitly signal completion of a Flowable in RxJava  I m trying to create a which is wrapping an   I push elements to my periodically but it seems that the completion event is implicit  I don t know how to signal that processing is complete  For example in my code  This prints  I checked the source of the interface but it seems that I can t signal that a is complete explicitly  How can I do so  In my program I publish events which have some delay between them and I would like to be explicit when to the event flow  Clarification  I have a long running process which emits events  I gather them in a queue and I expose a method which returns a Flowable which wraps around my queue  The problem is that there might be already elements in the queue when I create the Flowable  I will process the events only once and I know when the flow of events stops so I know when I need to complete the Flowable 
What are some good JVM based web server libraries  I currently have a Kotlin app that I d like to expose with a REST API server  I m finding really hard to decide for a web framework to build around it  My background is Node JS with express and I m trying to find something at least similar to it at the level of middleware and modularity  But since I just started learning Java recently the getting started part is the major entry barrier  What striked me as appropriate was Spark but I can t find a way to separate my routes between different files and have local per file middleware  I considered Play but it seemed that it needed a very big level of setup for a new app  even more if it s an existing one  While my app ain t that big I plan on evolving it so I need something that can scale appropriately  So I m asking what options do I have  I m really looking forward on working with Spark if I can tackle those 2 issues previously mentioned  any help about them is appreciated

Kotlin extensions synthetic properties  same object in multiple invocations of Fragment onViewCreated   I am using kotlin android extensions to import synthetic view properties from my layout to my Fragment  In my Fragment method I am calling on an view that is a synthetic import  This is working fine the first time the Fragment is instantiated  but the next time it comes along  my new listener is being added to the same view object as the last invocation  So now both objects are being triggered on text changes  with predictably poor results  The view from the first appearance of the Fragment is never dereferenced as far as I can tell  Here s my output from logging the view object which shows it s the same thing  First appearance  Second appearance  Of course  I can work around this issue by using to access my view instead of the synthetic reference  but I m wondering if anyone else is running in to this issue and if there is a better way to handle it  other than not using the synthetic view reference   FYI  Using Kotlin version 1 0 6

retryWhen   doesn t call what s inside Observable just   I have a test which in which I check retry mechanism for token authorisation  Inside that test I return null as token in the beginning and then I return a valid token  like this  Then I have an Observable  It should get the token  send it somewhere  wait for response and then it the response is wrong  retry the whole process again until it succeeds  The problem is that when kicks in  the source observable is not called again  just its initial value is returned immediately  On the other hand  this does work  Is it by design or is it a bug  If it s by design  what would be an elegant way to write this  because looks just ugly

Kotlin generics  Enforcing an interface for MVP In the below example I understand that BaseActivity cannot be supplied as the argument of   even though it implements the BaseView interface which seems like it is the same as V  An implementing Presenter may be supplied a subclass of BaseView  eg   which means that BaseView is not specific enough  However I still need to tell the presenter what its view is by passing a reference to the implementing activity  Ideally I can do all of this from the Base classes so that the MVP implementation details are almost invisible to implementing classes  I have found two ways to do this  but they have their problems  1  I could make each implementing activity override a field  but every single implementing activity would have the same identical line of code  Boilerplate much  It also doesn t seem in the spirit of generics  2  I could just assume that is always a and ignore the lint error  However this is dangerous and again is not in the spirit of generics  Is there a sexy way of doing all this in Kotlin  Some sort of constraint that all classes extending BaseActivity have to implement some kind of BaseView for instance

Java methods wrongly get automatically overloaded in kotlin Given a Java library containing the following  condensed  class  Since kotlin automagically converts suitable method names into overloaded operators  I can write    with the completely unexpected result that gets mutated by the infix division operation  And  furthermore  that the reference stored in points to the same object as Output  Since the library also provides an overload to write the result into another vector  I was wondering if I can  tell  kotlin not to use the provided method  I have already tried to provide an extension method to but that gets shadowed by the real member 
Kotlin  How are a Delegate s get  and setValue Methods accessed  I ve been wondering how delegated properties   by  Keyword  work under the hood  I get that by contract the delegate  right side of  by   has to implement a get and setValue      method  but how can that be ensured by the compiler and how can those methods be accessed at runtime  My initial thought was that obviously the delegates must me implementing some sort of  SuperDelegate  Interface  but it appears that is not the case  So the only option left  that I am aware of  would be to use Reflection to access those methods  possibly implemented at a low level inside the language itself  I find that to be somewhat weird  since by my understanding that would be rather inefficient  Also the Reflection API is not even part of the stdlib  which makes it even weirder  I am assuming that the latter is already  part of  the answer  So let me furthermore ask you the following  Why is there no SuperDelegate Interface that declare the getter and setter methods that we are forced to use anyway  Wouldn t that be much cleaner  The following is not essential to the question The described Interface s  are even already defined in ReadOnlyProperty and ReadWriteProperty  To decide which one to use could then be made dependable on whether we have a val var  Or even omit that since calling the setValue Method on val s is being prevented by the compiler and only use the ReadWriteProperty Interface as the SuperDelegate  Arguably when requiring a delegate to implement a certain interface the construct would be less flexible  Though that would be assuming that the Class used as a Delegate is possibly unaware of being used as such  which I find to be unlikely given the specific requirements for the necessary methods  And if you still insist  here s a crazy thought  Why not even go as far as to make that class implement the required interface via Extension  I m aware that s not possible as of now  but heck  why not  Probably there s a good  why not   please let me know as a side note

firebase db  models with Kotlin delegated properties I m using Kotlin objects to work with my Firebase Database models  as described in the guide  I have many fields that are stored as strings  but really are enums  so to be type safe I have enum fields in the models  plus a string delegated property that returns the firebase stored value  as suggested in a question I asked some time ago   Now  these fields work if I get set the string delegate in code  but firebase libs seem to skip them when converting to from database s json format  A simple example  The always gives a error  but works  if I delete field and make a normal property  It s similar for reading  Firebase gives no errors when getting a Weight object  but the field is never set to anything else than the default  But  if I manually do   the field properly returns   I m using firebase libs v10 0 1 Now  the questions  What can I do to make the delegated properties work correctly with firebase  I can try a different approach to the delegated enum fields  as long as the points from my original question are satisfied  readable  concise and type safe code   is there any way to see how exactly do firebase libs convert objects to from json  Or at least see the converted json  Maybe then I could tweak things myself  Unfortunately  everything firebase related shows as in AndroidStudio  UPDATE  I could of course add a method to each model  where I would construct a map containing all the properties needed in firebase  but it would be tiresome to do this for every model  and it solves the saving issue only  the enum fields still wouldn t be set when getting  The delegated props are also skipped when serializing with GSON  So maybe is there a generic way to make the delegated properties look like regular fields

Why do I need a repository and a service + contract I m new to Spring coming from PHP Larvel  Ruby Rails and Python Django  Coming from these frameworks I m used to only seeing the Model  Entity Dao   and everything else is handled by the Framework ORM QueryBuilders thus all there is for me to do is declare a model and add to it any operations relations methods I need  In these frameworks this is all I would have  However following this Spring tutorial I now have this  Model  Entity Dao     Only contains properties no methods except for GET SET and relations  Repository  UserServiceContract  And a service  Questions  Why do I need a and   From what I read on Spring guides on Repositories you already get the default methods on top of that you also have query methods where you can do or write annotated raw queries  So I m a bit confused why than declare a and just to implement that functionality which is already provided by the repository   Previously I would keep methods for working on with my Model in said Model however as I noticed from few resources this is not where they go in Spring so where do I keep them   Is this why there is a and   Should I really use the for database access only and in declare methods for working on with the User like

How to obtain a KType in Kotlin  I m experimenting with the reflection functionality in Kotlin  but I can t seem to understand how to obtain a KType value  Suppose I have a class that maps phrases to object factories  In case of ambiguity  the user can supply a parameter that narrows the search to only factories that return that type of object  or some sub type   needs to accept just about anything  including   which from my experience seems to be treated somewhat specially  By default  it should be something like   which means  do not exclude any factories   How do I assign a default value  or any value  to

Kotlin  How can extension functions within a type be accessed externally  I often come across the scenario where I have abstract extension functions within a type  Having the functions be extension functions allows very minimalistic implementations because it gives automatic context  Unfortunately  the only way I know of to use these functions is to write boilerplate standard functions which pass to the extensions  This way I m able to use the functions like so  Is there a better  more idiomatic way to use the extension functions outside of the type

Multiple constructors on an immutable  data  class I m trying to implement an immutable data class with more than one constructor  I felt that something like this should be possible  Of course  it isn t  Kotlin expects the call to the main constructor be declared at the top  That s no good either  as the call is executed before the constructor body and can not access the local variables  I can do this  of course  But this will check the assertion too late  and does not scale very well  The only way I see to get close to the desired behaviour is this using a helper function  which can t be defined non static on    This does not strike me as a very elegant pattern  so I m guessing I m missing something here  Is there an elegant  idiomatic way to have  complex  secondary constructors on immutable data classes in Kotlin

How should I set up mutable test fixtures in Spek  I m trying to get my head around fixtures in Spek  The Calculator example in the docs is easy to follow  but I m not sure how to go about structuring setup teardown when some of the fixtures are stateful  For example  if I was testing a list  From what I understand  in Spek the block is only evaluated once  so there is only ever one instance of List  The docs helpfully suggest using test fixtures  but then unhelpfully fail to give an example  I assume the following doesn t work because Kotlin doesn t understand that Spek will definitely call before I can get around that by making the variable nullable  but then I have to use nullsafe operators everywhere  which sucks because I know it s never null  This also works  but means that every bit of setup code now needs to be duplicated in two places Excuse me if any of this is obvious  but I m coming from JUnit world where absolutely everything  bar statics  is torn down and rebuilt before every test  so this all seems rather alien 
Singleton database object with parameterized initialization on startup  I m attempting to create a single database instance that can be used by multiple classes  using keyword in Kotlin   However  I wanted to be able to specify the database name before the singleton instance is created  Since a singleton object cannot be initialized with a parameter  I was wondering if what I m doing is valid  or if there s a better way of doing things  And in another file Basically  I m encapsulating a  database container  in the singleton object by using lazy initialization for the database container and providing lateinit vars for specifying the database name and having an initialization function in the singleton object to initialize the database container  This is so that in my main method when I first start up my application  I can load the database name from some local properties file and call to create my database singleton that needs to be accessed by multiple other classes  Is this a good approach to do what I want  or are there better ways of doing things

Wicket NumberTextField in Kotlin throws ClassCastException when submitted I m having some issues with a Wicket  8 0 0 M4  NumberTextField in Kotlin  1 1 0   My stripped down form looks like this  After submitting the form I get the following stacktrace  If I use instead of everything works fine  But since my NumberTextField is optional I don t want to have it pre initialized with 0  Me and my colleagues were trying to change the type signature of the Model in every way we could imagine but came to no solution  A co worker suggested to write a custom Wicket converter since Kotlins Int is represendeted as a primitive type  From the docs   On the JVM  non nullable values of this type are represented as values of the primitive type int    Even though I don t know yet if this would work it seems like an overkill for me  Another hack I could think of  writing some JavaScript to delete the zero from the input field  Also not really something I would want to do  Question  Is there a simple solution to my problem   And as a bonus question  has already anyone written a larger Wicket application in Kotlin and could tell me if this combination is ready for prime time to develop a critical project with this stack or is my problem just the tip of the iceberg    edit  Solution as pointed out by svenmeier  Using works  Or as an alternative

Why does kotlin have componentN functions in data class  if they already have getters and setters  There is a data class in kotlin  e g  And I can call component1 and component2 functions to access the properties  However  as I declare the property var  I have getter and setter  and if I declare property val I have the getter  Are componentN functions are redundant in this case  and why do we need them  because getters seem to be much more self explanatory

kotlin  Generic to different types I need linear functions like this  Then  I need the same thing for vectors  As you can see  the two Linear classes are identical  except for argument types   Now  I can not make the class generic  as Double and Vector3d do not have a common superclass  If I want to write Linear just once  my only option is my own Double type  which than has a common interface with Vector3d  However  this means I can not use 0 in the source code any longer  but I have to use MyDouble 0  everywhere  I could overload the constructor of Linear to accept Doubles  and create the MyDouble objects internally  however  I would need to do this for every single method in my API  Is there a better solution

Implement only one method from interface in anonymous class Is it possible in Kotlin to create an anonymous class implementing a certain interface and only implement the functions you ll need  For example I want to create a class implementing which has 3 methods  onAnimationStart onAnimationEnd onAnimationRepeat If I only want to use the callback  can I just do something like this  The way I ve done this in Java was by creating a class which implemented the interface  just create anonymous class of that class and override the methods I need  I was hoping Kotlin has a better  less verbose  approach on this 
HTTP headers not returned on EC2 I have a Spring Boot application deployed on 2 EC2 instances  staging and production environments   I have an endpoint that is used for downloading a file  It looks like this  the app is written in Kotlin   When I execute a download request on the staging machine everything is fine  I get back the file and the response has the headers set  These are the headers that I can see in Postman  When I do the same request on production  the response body contains the file content  but the 2 headers that I set manually   Content Type  and  Content Disposition   are missing  Both machines have the exact same JAR deployed in a Docker container  Both calls are done directly against the EC2 instances  using their private IPs  so no ELB is involved  The configuration of the 2 instances is identical  with no differences that I could find in the AWS Console  Do you know what might cause this  Is there a setting in EC2 that can prevent some HTTP headers for being sent back in responses  I cannot find any reason for why the headers are sent back in one case and not in the other

What s Kotlin Backing Field For  As a Java developer  the concept of a backing field is a bit foreign to me  Given  What s this backing field good for  Kotlin docs said  Classes in Kotlin cannot have fields  However  sometimes it is necessary to have a backing field when using custom accessors  Why  Whats the difference with using the properties name itself inside the setter  eg 
Kotlin  table array based on entries with dynamic fields I am doing a kotlin port of g truc gli and I am actually considering a slight design change  Gli uses an internal rapresentation of texture format  types  swizzles  etc   and so on   In this test  it instantiates the GL struct  passing the profile and then reads the translated gli format  The will fetch from a table and the profile  you pass in the constructor  is needed because some of the entry fields in that table are profile dependant  Each entry in that table is the following struct  At the moment I implemented essentially the same  a GL class which at the instatiation will initialize   And my is made of classes  But I d like to avoid instance design if possible  because usually I am going to use the instance just for the texture creation and nothing else  Also  in this way I d avoid creating a new class  So I thought about one possible alternative solution and I came up using lambdas and a dynamic table  with lambda based entries  I d replace the with an   then set the first and then the next call will fetch from the table and execute the lambda  In this way my would change in Since most of the entry fields are static  that is for example  I could write additional constructors that received plain values instead lambdas to avoid wrapping everything in   but that s it  Is this a good way to implement a table based on dynamic entries or is there a better simpler solution for that 
BDD on Android with Kotlin I am considering an approach fo BDD tests on Android  The sample app   a simple messenger   has been made in Kotlin  so will be the tests  I ended up with something like this   I ended up with this assessment   The Given is a start state The When is an action The Then is an end state The Then is also a start state for the next action So I can Given  > When  > Then  > When  > Then  Each is a test case providing its own data  Each  step  is an extension on the   or classes as in  The method is an extension on   using Espresso  So  I am here to get feedback  criticism and or suggestions  I do not really know if it the place for this kind of question  is it one

IntelliJ and Android Studio icons for Kotlin files I have been tinkering trying to understand what IntelliJ  and Android Studio  are doing to my Kotlin file icons  In the picture you can see that Kotlin files come with two different icons   either a rectangle with a small  K  or a circled C with a small  K   circled in red in the picture   The rectangle version also includes a useful   kt  suffix  After some tinkering with this black box of a problem   it appears that if the kotlin file just declares a class matching the file name then it gets a  circled C  icon  But if it does anything that is un Java like   such as declaring a variable outside the class  e g      then the icon is shifted to the rectangle with the  K   The icon documentation here suggests that IntelliJ thinks the rectangle with the  K  is a  Kotlin file  whereas the circled C is a  Kotlin class   Does anybody know if there is a deeper meaning to this  I think I will include a declaration outside the class just to get my Kotlin file icon symbols all to match  Then they will also have the handy   kt  extension to clearly indicate that they are Kotlin files  For example   here is code that will change your icon to a rectangle with a  K  in file Foo kt

Passing functions to functions in Kotlin I am starting to use Vaadin with Kotlin  and have created the following extension method  This lets me add a button to a container  with an optional click listener  and an optional icon   I now want to add two buttons to the component  one for up  one for down  to allow me to move items up and down a list  Therefore  I want to call twice  The logic in the lambda is going to be the same  the only difference is that in one the item s position will be incremented and in the other decremented  I am trying to create a function that can be passed to the   and to save me writing two functions that do almost the same thing  I want to be able to pass to that function a reference to and   I can t get it to work  Either it won t compile or I get s when it runs  This is where I have got to  If I remove the cast  it won t compile  and if I leave the cast  I get the following  Is there a way to achieve what I want  I don t really want to change the signature of the function expected by    note this is a question about Kotlin  rather than about Vaadin  so I am leaving the Vaadin tag off

Should hashCode   return an object s unique ID In my Kotlin Java project  I have written some model classes that inherit an abstract class   These model classes will be used to represent data from a database  In the database  there is an ID column that contains unique integer identifiers  So when I use the model classes  it is guaranteed that the property of each will unique  After reading this the Java specification for   My question is  Is it good practice to return this unique identifier in   Note  I am aware that in Kotlin  we can use classes so that the compiler automatically derives predefined members like       etc  but classes cannot be classes   However  I could make subclasses of classes   I m not sure whether or not this would be the better option for this use case

Enabling Spring Security global method security breaks dependency injection  with Kotlin  I am currently working on the authentication system for a Spring Boot application  and I ve been having issues since I tried to enable Spring Security s global method security  The Spring Boot application being a REST API  the authentication system is a bit non standard  so I have set up a custom authentication filter that I add to the object that pre processes the request  calls a custom and gives the final object to the   And that works fine  However  with this method  I have to set up all the access rules for my endpoints directly in my overridden method  which I find less than practical  so I tried to use Spring Security annotation directly in my controllers instead  The problem is  if I add to my security configuration  all the attributes in my controllers are not injected  It works fine if I set or if I remove the annotation altogether  but of course this isn t what I want  Here a stacktrace that shows the request handler being called  and the attributes not being initialized   kotlin UninitializedPropertyAccessException  lateinit property accountService has not been initialized        at com example api module account AccountController addAccountRole AccountController kt 105  ~ main  na         at sun reflect NativeMethodAccessorImpl invoke0 Native Method  ~ na 1 8 0 121         at sun reflect NativeMethodAccessorImpl invoke NativeMethodAccessorImpl java 62  ~ na 1 8 0 121         at sun reflect DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl invoke DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl java 43  ~ na 1 8 0 121         at java lang reflect Method invoke Method java 498  ~ na 1 8 0 121         at org springframework web method support InvocableHandlerMethod doInvoke InvocableHandlerMethod java 205  ~ spring web 4 3 7 RELEASE jar 4 3 7 RELEASE         at org springframework web method support InvocableHandlerMethod invokeForRequest InvocableHandlerMethod java 133  ~ spring web 4 3 7 RELEASE jar 4 3 7 RELEASE         at org springframework web servlet mvc method annotation ServletInvocableHandlerMethod invokeAndHandle ServletInvocableHandlerMethod java 116  ~ spring webmvc 4 3 7 RELEASE jar 4 3 7 RELEASE         at org springframework web servlet mvc method annotation RequestMappingHandlerAdapter invokeHandlerMethod RequestMappingHandlerAdapter java 827  ~ spring webmvc 4 3 7 RELEASE jar 4 3 7 RELEASE         at org springframework web servlet mvc method annotation RequestMappingHandlerAdapter handleInternal RequestMappingHandlerAdapter java 738  ~ spring webmvc 4 3 7 RELEASE jar 4 3 7 RELEASE         at org springframework web servlet mvc method AbstractHandlerMethodAdapter handle AbstractHandlerMethodAdapter java 85  ~ spring webmvc 4 3 7 RELEASE jar 4 3 7 RELEASE         at org springframework web servlet DispatcherServlet doDispatch DispatcherServlet java 963  ~ spring webmvc 4 3 7 RELEASE jar 4 3 7 RELEASE         at org springframework web servlet DispatcherServlet doService DispatcherServlet java 897  ~ spring webmvc 4 3 7 RELEASE jar 4 3 7 RELEASE         at org springframework web servlet FrameworkServlet processRequest FrameworkServlet java 970  ~ spring webmvc 4 3 7 RELEASE jar 4 3 7 RELEASE         at org springframework web servlet FrameworkServlet doPost FrameworkServlet java 872  ~ spring webmvc 4 3 7 RELEASE jar 4 3 7 RELEASE         at javax servlet http HttpServlet service HttpServlet java 648  ~ tomcat embed core 8 5 11 jar 8 5 11         at org springframework web servlet FrameworkServlet service FrameworkServlet java 846  ~ spring webmvc 4 3 7 RELEASE jar 4 3 7 RELEASE         at javax servlet http HttpServlet service HttpServlet java 729  ~ tomcat embed core 8 5 11 jar 8 5 11         at org apache catalina core ApplicationFilterChain internalDoFilter ApplicationFilterChain java 230  ~ tomcat embed core 8 5 11 jar 8 5 11         at org apache catalina core ApplicationFilterChain doFilter ApplicationFilterChain java 165  ~ tomcat embed core 8 5 11 jar 8 5 11         at org apache tomcat websocket server WsFilter doFilter WsFilter java 52  ~ tomcat embed websocket 8 5 11 jar 8 5 11         at org apache catalina core ApplicationFilterChain internalDoFilter ApplicationFilterChain java 192  ~ tomcat embed core 8 5 11 jar 8 5 11         at org apache catalina core ApplicationFilterChain doFilter ApplicationFilterChain java 165  ~ tomcat embed core 8 5 11 jar 8 5 11         at com example api security HeaderAuthenticationFilter doFilter HeaderAuthenticationFilter kt 46  ~ main  na

Mixing class and function generics in Kotlin  I m trying to create an interface that defines a single method  The type of the argument for that method must be a type parameter of the interface  because implementations of the interface will have unique implementations for this parameter  Fine so far  but the catch is that the parameter also has a type argument that is tied to the method  Can I have a parameter of a type defined as a class type argument  which also has its own type argument that s tied to the method  Put another way  I am trying to build an api client interface with two implementations  Each client makes api calls based on objects that are passed into their functions  RxJava + execute  and yes  I am unduly proud of the name   My issue is with how to define the method in the interface  Let me lay out some sample code  my actual code isn t using   don t worry   I would like to be able to use it like this  Is it possible to create an interface like this or do generics not work like that

Efficient map and filter combination vs stdlibs I m trying to write an efficient solution to a common map filter paradigm  In Kotlin  you can write code that looks like this  Generically  I m applying a map  then filtering the mapped values based on a condition  However  an intermediate collection is created for this  This seems unnecessary  I wrote a little function that should do the same thing  but without the intermediate collection  However  IntelliJ is suggesting a stdlib replacement for my function that would make it look like  Which turns my optimization straight back into the original code I wrote and re introduces the inefficiency of creating multiple collections  Is there some optimization going on here that I am not aware of

Kotlin type safe builder DSLs  safety for the outermost function I m going to use the official example from the documentation that implements a DSL for some HTML creation  Since Kotlin 1 1  the annotation allows us to restrict the scope of the functions in our classes  like the example does with the annotation  This gives us an error when trying to write incorrectly structured code like this  However  this doesn t prevent nesting the outermost function  which is the entry point to the DSL  For example  with the example as it is now  this can be written down without problems  Is there any way to make a DSL safer in this regard

How to control flow without  flatMap  which breaks a reactive stream preventing operators like distinctUntilChanged from working on the entire stream I want to handle a different observable chain of logic for different implementations of   This can easily be achieved with a sealed class algebraic data type union +   but this breaks the stream  where operators like only work within the function  not on the whole stream itself  Note  this is a simplified example  While I m just printing here  I actually want to perform different actions  render the UI differently  based on the implementing type of This can be accomplished with a subject relay  but but that would create a disconnected  mutable stream  which I would also like to avoid

Kotlin  ProGuard erases properties attributes TL DR  with proguard enabled  when using reflection  my properties look private  non nullable and without annotations  despite proguard config that should keep all these attributes  I have some simple es with public properties to serve as data models in my Android app  Later  when doing generic  de serialization of said classes  I filter the property list like this  It works normally on my debug builds  I mean it selects the properties I want it to   But  when doing a release build  where proguard is active  the result is empty  To check why  I logged all the relevant stuff about the properties of one class    turns out their field reads  and all other attributes remain the same as on a debug build   I already have a line in proguard config to keep all the models  I tried this one before  with same result  Why how does proguard affect property visibility  Should I modify the config somehow  Or am I missing something else here  UPDATE  It seems like visibility is not the only thing  also doesn t work  it returns for properties declared nullable  And annotations also seem to get lost  even though I asked proguard to keep them  Is there any way to work around this  It pretty much renders 2 weeks of my work useless   
Why does smart cast fail for nullable value after setting value and checking if it s null  Lets say I have the following class  Why is it that I get the error   Is it something to do with not being thread safe  Based on the null safety docs  I thought this would work for either one of 1  that and are set in the same function above their use as params and 2  that their use as params is wrapped in an if statement checking their value

Generics on KProperty1 getDelegate too restrictive  I am trying to obtain all property delegates of a certain type in a class hierarchy  This is presenting me with some issues  For a start  there seems to be no straightforward way to obtain a class  superclass in Kotlin  The first way I tried was to use Java s   But this requires an unchecked cast  because Kotlin will not allow me to convert a back to Kotlin  because apparently in T means it could be something that is not Any  whatever that might be   Type parameter has an upper bound  Any  that cannot be satisfied capturing  in  projection    So I tried a pure Kotlin solution  First get all superclasses including interfaces    and then filter out every interface  But there is nothing on that tells me if it s an interface  So I have to go to Java for that again  And it again requires an unchecked cast  because for some reason is of type and not   Am I missing something here  I must be  Now for the actual question  trying to obtain all property delegate instances in a class hierarchy  First I wrote a function to obtain the instances for one class  Works fine  But of course I also need all the properties declared in superclasses  So naturally I tried to change the receiver to which of course results in me not being able to call anymore  How do I solve this  I already tried using   but it falls short if a subclass overrides a property which is delegated in a parent class  In that case it will only list the overridden property  which does not allow me to access the property delegate instance  Edit  I did some more testing  and the following Java code compiles just fine  as I would expect  What would be the equivalent Kotlin code  Edit²  Same for the super class stuff  The following  albeit still ugly workaround  compiles in Java  but not in Kotlin  leaving out null check here  
Can Applicative be implemented  nicely  in kotlin  I have defined a type like this  For this class I have defined the monadic   A very useful functional pattern is   if applied to this would allow me to invoke a function with arbritrary argument list if and only if all arguments are   This is a technique that usually relies on partial application  aka currying  which AFAIK isn t supported out of the box in kotlin  I ve seen some libraries try to do currying but it seems to me currying is not a commonly recognized idiom in kotlin  What I ideally would like to write is something like this  But I can t come up with how the signatures should look like  I could make a function for each arity of the function but that quickly gets cumbersome   This seems to be how funKTionale implements currying  Any ideas welcome

Library to detect memory leak in android using Kotlin I m using Leak Canary to prevent memory leaks in Android   using Kotlin  this library still works  There is another for Kotlin  Leak Canary can detect  based on source code  i am right   and with head dumbs  the reference of context passed from activity fragmento to Async class  constructors  and in case when WeakReferences are not used properly whenever the user leaves an activity when the Async does not finish its process  the LeakCanary detect a memory leak  How its works for Kotlin  Leak Canary is based on  its analyses  generated bytecode and there is real no difference between using either Java code or Kolin

Boilerplate project configuration in Gradle with Gradle Script Kotlin I m currently trying to improve the way our projects share their configuration  We have lots of different multi module gradle projects for all of our libraries and microservices  i e  many git repos   My main goals are  To not have my Nexus repository URL duplicated in every project  also  I can safely assume that it won t change  To make my custom Gradle plugins available to every project with minimal boilerplate   duplication  they should be available to every project  and the only thing the project cares about is the version it s using  No magic   it should be obvious to developers how everything is configured My current solution is a custom gradle distribution with an init script that  adds and our Nexus repository to the project repos  very similar to the Gradle init script documentation example  except it adds repos as well as validating them  configures an extension that allows our gradle plugins to be added to the buildscript classpath  using this workaround   It also adds our Nexus repo as a buildscript repo as that s where the plugins are hosted  We have quite a few plugins  built upon Netflix s excellent nebula plugins  for various boilerplate  standard project setup  kotlin setup  test setup  etc   releasing  publishing  documentation  etc and it means our project files are pretty much just for dependencies  While this approach works  allows reproducible builds  unlike our previous setup which applied a build script from a URL   and allows working offline  it does make it a little magical and I was wondering if I could do things better  This was all triggered by reading a comment recently by a gradle dev on github  I m not sure where  stating that a build should work without relying on an init script  i e  implying that init scripts should just do things like the documented example   preventing unauthorised repos  etc  My idea was to write some extension functions that would allow me to add our Nexus repo and plugins to a build in a way that looked like they were built into gradle  similar to the extension functions and provided by gradle script kotlin  So I created my extension functions in a kotlin gradle project  With the plan to use them in my project s as follows  However  Gradle was unable to see my functions when used in the block  unable to compile script   Using them in the normal project repos dependencies worked fine though  they are visible and work as expected   If this worked  I was hoping to bundle the jar into my custom distribution   meaning my init script could just do simple validation instead of hiding away the magical plugin and repo configuration  The extension functions wouldn t need to change  so it wouldn t require releasing a new Gradle distribution when plugins change  What I tried  adding my jar to the test project s buildscript classpath  i e      doesn t work  maybe this doesn t work by design as it doesn t seem right to be adding a dependency to that s referred to in the same block  putting the functions in  which works for normal project deps repos but not   but is not a real solution a

Tornadofx Javafx   How to reload a view   component So its a basic question  What I am trying to achieve is refreshing views from another views  Lets say I have a view EmployeeTableView which shows a tabular representation of employees by doing a REST API call  In another view  I have a the filter EmployeeFilterView wherein I have gender  salary range  employee type  etc  I also have a userContext object in which I store the user preferences  So by default lets say I have stored the value of gender filter to be Male  salary range to be ALL  etc  This object is send as a parameter to the EmployeeTableView  When the EmployeeTableView is loaded I do a restAPI call with the userContext values to get the employee details  So that works fine  Now I change the gender filter to Female and assign this value in my userContext  Now if I could just reload the EmployeeTableView with the userContext object  the restapi call would get the updated values  But how can I do that   Also suggest a better approach if you have

Where is Kotlin s `org jetbrain annotations ReadOnly` annotation provided for Gradle Maven projects  I have a mixed Kotlin+Java project that is being built using IDEA and am now experimenting with trying to take advantage of Gradle for that project  In the project  some of the Java code is annotated with Kotlin s annotation  so that immutable collections are correctly recognized as such from the project s Kotlin code  When building in IDEA  the annotation was coming from    And if I were building from the command line it surely would come from either the Kotlin compiler s deprecated or it s newly unified   both of which provide the annotation the way they re supposed to   When building via Gradle  however  the project depends on   which in turn depends on   which provides only a subset of the annotations in either the Kotlin compiler s kotlin stdlib JAR or IDEA s bundled kotlin runtime JAR  It doesn t provide the annotation necessary for instructing Kotlin from Java code that a collection type is immutable      So  where is a Gradle Maven project supposed to be finding this missing part of the Kotlin stdlib

Write call transaction is dropped in TransactionalEventListener I am using spring boot 1 4 1  with hibernate 5 0 1 Final   I noticed that when I try to write to the db from within handler the call is simply ignored  A read call works just fine  When I say ignore  I mean there is no write in the db and there are no logs  I even enabled log4jdbc and still no logs which mean no hibernate session was created  From this  I reckon  somewhere in spring boot we identify that its a transaction event handler and ignore a write call  Here is an example  Now if I force a new Transaction by annotating a new transaction with connection is made and everything works fine  I dont like that there is complete silence in logs when this write is dropped  again reads succeed   Is there a known bug  How to enable the handler to start a new transaction  If I do Propogation Requires new on my handleEnqueue event  it does not work  Besides  enabling log4jdbc which successfully logs reads writes I have following settings in spring  Thanks

Does Kotlin have an equivalent to Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals in Swift  Implicitly unwrapped optionals are a useful feature of Swift for things like UI elements that are not assigned during a class s constructor  but can be safely be assumed to be non null for the majority of functions  as they will have been assigned in a viewDidLoad   eg  Is there an equivalent for Kotlin  or a workaround that achieves the same effect 
Kotlin factory interface with generics I have a factory interface in my Kotlin code  like so  using Guava s    So far  so good  This is very easy to use when calling it  however implementation almost always requires an unsafe cast  This is ugly  but I have overcome it with a nice trick  First  a little utility function for creating instances  Now I added a companion object to my factory interface  This allows me to have the unchecked  but safe  cast in one place and I can write code like the following  However this approach also falls apart as soon as I want to implement a factory that takes a and returns a   because there is nowhere for me to put that parameter  I am eager to hear your suggestions 
React Kotlin wrapper setState method On the react docs here   It says that the following code is unsafe to use because state is updated asynchronously  And instead to pass in the previous state and props like this  However  the React Kotlin wrapper located here   Has the state change passed in as an extension function of state  which modifies the variables on the state object  If I call function like this in Kotlin  Isn t that equivalent to the unsafe method above  Wouldn t it need to be implemented like this in the React Kotlin wrapper  And then called like this 
Rx Kotlin awaitTerminalEvent never getting onComplete I am trying to get a better understanding of how to do unit tests with Rx Kotlin  but I have not been able to successfully set the subject to  completed   As a result  I am always waiting for the timeout of 5 seconds  the onComplete should be immediate  and then fail on assertComplete  My understanding of awaitTerminalEvent is that it should only block until the onComplete is called  I have also looked into TestScheduler  but I do not believe that it should be required here  Any help or documentation that can lead me in the right direction would be much appreciated

How to implement finalize   in kotlin  Today I m implementing a in kotlin  and as I have done in java in the past  I want to implement a as a last resort fallback in case the client code forgets to close it  rendering critical resource un reclaimed  I consider this resource critical enough to add this fallback  despite the unreliability of this fallback  However  does not declare a method  which means I can t simplydo this  This isn t good  at least not as good as it should be  Now I revert to plain Java as a workaround  Does anyone knows how to do this in pure Kotlin  PS  My current workaround  FinalizedCloseable java  Kotlin  But this workaround requires a superclass  If next time my other already got a superclass  this workaround won t work without a lot of boilerplate  EDIT  Now I know how to implement finalize    but IDEA kotlin plugin isn t smart enough to know that this is a finalizer and thus mark it with some warning  After struggling for a while I found how to suppress these warnings  and I want to share it

Why can t type parameter in Kotlin have any other bounds if it s bounded by another type parameter  Here is the minimal demo code that shows this problem  When I try to compile it  compiler will complain  I read Kotlin Language Specification  but only find the following bound restriction  It doesn t explain the restriction I meet  I explore Kotlin s issue tracker  and I find an issue about this restriction  Allow to inherit a type parameter from another type parameter and a class   KT 13768  However  this issue has been rejected by the following reason  update on May 6th  2017  this issue has been reopened by Stanislav Erokhin   So the question is  why can t we compile the code correctly to JVM if we remove this restriction  The same demo works in Scala  It indicates that Scala can compile the code correctly to JVM  Why can t Kotlin  Is it a restriction to guarantee a decidable subtyping in Kotlin  I guess  Subtyping is undecidable for Scala  Scala has a Turing complete type system   Kotlin may want decidable subtyping like C     Update after answered by  erokhins   There are some subtle issues when supporting something forbidden by Java but allowed by JVM  especially in Java interoperability  I find an interesting issue when digging into bytecode generated by scalac  I modify Scala code in demo as follow  Scalac will generate the following signature  Invoke with in Scala will succeed  since Scalas invoke signature   but invoke with in Java will fail  since Java invokes signature   causing in runtime  It means scalac generates something cannot be invoked in Java after relaxing this restriction  Kotlin may meet the same issue after relaxing it

Kotlin  Difference between object and companion object in a class What is the difference between an object and a companion object in a class in kotlin  Example  I already read that companion object shall be used  if the containing parameters methods are closely related to its class  But why is there also the possibility of declaring a normal object in the class  Because it behaves exactly like the companion  but it must have a name  Is there maybe a difference in its  static   I m from the java side  lifecycle

Migrating Groovy gradle to Kotlin gradle  ext missing  or closure conversion  not sure  I have some Git helper written in groovy  git gradle  Now I converted whole stuff to Kotlin  looks like this now  git gradle kts  Main script includes these like this  Now  problem is  that main script can t recognize gitHash   method  most likely because I can t expose it via ext closure  Same as in Groovy script  this method seems to be private  or local  in that file  As far I understand  ext closure is shorthand of  project extra  which I was trying to integrate  Also  it seems that typical Groovy closure have no equivalent in Kotlin  I stuck here  without any idea what else could I try  Any ideas welcome  UPDATE With  I m able to work with it in Groovy like  But it doesn t work with Kotlin script    because invoke   points to call     extension methods here   And while I m trying to use it as closure it leads to such error  It looks like I m missing something   
Kotlin check if function requires instance parameter If a is created using then when it s later referenced you don t need to pass that instance  when using    Though if it s created using  not an instance of   it s required to pass an instance  So my question is how can I easily find out whether I need to pass that instance parameter and is this parameter mandatory  I found a way to do this  but it isn t quite nice and I wonder if there s an easier or recommended way to solve this  Thanks

Writing Unit tests in Kotlin  sharing variables  I am trying to create some functional tests in Kotlin to make requests to a Cart Java service using Rest Assured library  Since I want the tests to behave procedurally I was hoping I could store the result of the first API request and pass it to the next Unit test  i e  createCartTest     > cartId   > getCartForWebsiteTest cartId  Never really used Kotlin  so looking for advice in what would be the best way to test all the API endpoints are working  Or would it be better to make another request inside the same function and pass the result to the next step  What is the best way to share variables across tests  Thanks

Mixed Kotlin + Java with Maven  unresolved reference I have a Maven project with Kotlin code which calls Java code which calls Kotlin code   also calls directly  I m trying to build this with using exactly the Maven settings described in kotlinlang s Maven docs  If doesn t call  but I leave in the project  then this builds just fine  The docs say that the Kotlin compiler should be invoked before the Java compiler  which suggests to me that all Kotlin code needs to compile before any Java code  i e  with this setup you can call Kotlin from Java but not vice versa  However  the docs describe this setup as just  mixed code applications   not  calling Kotlin from Java   In other words  this failure seems consistent with what the docs seem to imply but not with what they directly say    or I m just misunderstanding something  I want to call each language from the other  Is there a Maven configuration that will do this  please   I looked at various StackExchange questions on mixed code settings and none of the solutions works for me   Adding the code as requested  pom xml  <project xmlns=  xmlns xsi=     xsi schemaLocation=  >    <modelVersion>4 0 0< modelVersion>    <groupId>com example kotlindemo< groupId>    <artifactId>kotlin demo< artifactId>    <packaging>jar< packaging>    <version>1 0 SNAPSHOT< version>    <name>kotlin demo< name>    <properties>        <kotlin version>1 1 2 2< kotlin version>         <kotlin compiler incremental>true< kotlin compiler incremental>        <main class>com example kotlindemo HelloKt< main class>    < properties>    <dependencies>        <dependency>            <groupId>org jetbrains kotlin< groupId>            <artifactId>kotlin stdlib< artifactId>            <version>$ kotlin version < version>        < dependency>    < dependencies>    <build>        <plugins>            <plugin>                <artifactId>kotlin maven plugin< artifactId>                <groupId>org jetbrains kotlin< groupId>                <version>$ kotlin version < version>                <executions>                    <execution>                        <id>compile< id>                        <phase>process sources< phase>                        <goals> <goal>compile< goal> < goals>                        <configuration>                            <sourceDirs>                                <sourceDir>$ project basedir  src main kotlin< sourceDir>                                <sourceDir>$ project basedir  src main java< sourceDir>                            < sourceDirs>                        < configuration>                    < execution>                    <execution>                        <id>test compile< id>                        <goals> <goal>test compile< goal> < goals>                        <configuration>                            <sourceDirs>                                <sourceDir>$ project basedir  src test kotlin< sourceDir>                                <sourceDir>$ project basedir  src test java< sourceDir>                            < sourceDirs>                        < configuration>                    < execution>                < executions>            < plugin>            <plugin>                <groupId>org apache maven plugins< groupId>                <artifactId>maven compiler plugin< artifactId>                <version>3 5 1< version>                <executions>                    <    Replacing default compile as it is treated specially by maven   >                    <execution>                        <id>default compile< id>                        <phase>none< phase>

 lateinit  or  by lazy  when defining global android widget var val When defining a global variable  e g    is it preferable to use or   I initially thought using would be preferred as its immutable but I m not entirely sure  example  example  Are there any benefits of using one over the other when defining a global var val  Are there any pitfalls with using to define a val  Is the decision just based on whether you want a mutable or immutable value

Are Kotlin inline functions less expensive than Java anonymous classes  Heads up  I m writing some of this from memory so I may have some of the concepts incorrect  Java has the ability to write an anonymous function  This is useful when you have a listener interface for some kind of event  As an example  The anonymous listener will be compiled as a class that is called something like   This is an underlying design decision of the Java language  Everything is an object  even anonymous functions  This becomes an issue when you want to write a more functionally driven code base  The large amount of anonymous classes creates a large class count  which can be a problem on constrained platforms such as Android  In Kotlin functions are much more first class from a source code point of view  My question is  does Kotlin compile these functions down to byte code more efficiently than Java does with anonymous classes or will I run into the same issues as the large class count in Java  Thanks

Accessing field of a different instance of the same class in Kotlin Consider this Kotlin code  Assume that returns if this instance is a instance  If not will return the parent instance  In Java you are allowed to access directly field of a different instance of same class like this   I am not saying that is a best thing to do  I simplified it for demostration   Comparing to Java  it would be nice to be able to do following  However this does not work and unfortunately it makes the code less readable  Especially if you have a lot of such variables  which are bound to this

Share a Kotlin module with an Android and Desktop project I have a game that I am working on that uses the LibGDX game framework  Currently the platforms I am targeting are Desktop  PC  Mac  Linux  via a platform independent jar and Android  The project is hosted at  Feel free to take a look if you need to  The bulk of the code is in a module called and is written entirely in Kotlin  This module is linked into both the Desktop and Android projects  This works fine for Android versions 7 1+ and for desktop  For all other versions of Android I get a pile of exceptions on anonymous functions such as this  Exception Sample  It seems to be caused by an incompatibility with the JVM that Kotlin targets by default  1 8  and the JVM level that older versions of Android support  1 6   I could be wrong but this explains why the latest version of Android works as it supports a later version of the JVM  The solution should be as simple as forcing Kotlin to emit JVM byte code as version 1 6 but I can t seem to work it out  If you compile Kotlin directly into an Android  this seems to be handled by using the Gradle plugin  Unfortunately I can t use this plugin for the core module because it should not have any Android dependencies  I tried to override the JVM version using the build settings mentioned at  like this  However  it did not seem to work no matter which Gradle file I placed it in  In fact I get a  Cannot resolve symbol  kotlinOptions   error shown by Intellij when I try it  It is possible that the Kotlin team have changed something and the documentation has not been updated  I can override the Kotlin settings manually in the Intellij module settings but it gets overridden every time I sync the gradle project and is not a good long term solution  The project is designed to be IDE independent  Does anyone know how I could set up the core module for max compatibility with older versions of Android  I currently have the minimum API level set to 9 as this is the current LibGDX default but I m willing to set this higher if it would be too difficult to target such a low API level  Edit 1  I just extracted the jar file produced by the core module and examined the class files using the tool  I ran the following command on a random class file and it output text with the following text using this question List of Java class file format major version numbers  I determined that the class file is actually targeting JVM 1 6  Therefore my original theory is wrong and there is another reason why older Android versions cannot load classes generated by Kotlin lambdas

Converting container types in kotlin  Maybe I missed something obvious    All over the doc it seems to me that Kotlin has various kinds of sequences  which don t interoperate  Even if it may be inefficient to copy a sequence   when I need to pass it to a function as a semantically same but different type  that can t be helped  So I came up  only for Int and one way  with these constructors and converters  Is there any reason not to have all such variants  maybe inline  in the standard library  The 3rd one even allows a nice syntax for initialization

Kotlin stdlib operatios vs for loops I wrote the following code  IntellJ  in my case AndroidStudio  is asking me if I want to replace the for loop with operations from stdlib  This results in the following code  Now I must say  I like the changed code  I find it easier to write than for loops when I come up with similar situations  However upon reading what function does  I realized that this is a lot slower code compared to the for loop  function creates a new list containing only the elements from src that match the predicate  So there is one more list created and one more loop in the stdlib version of the code  Ofc for small lists it might not be important  but in general this does not sound like a good alternative  Especially if one should chain more methods like this  you can get a lot of additional loops that could be avoided by writing a for loop  My question is what is considered good practice in Kotlin  Should I stick to for loops or am I missing something and it does not work as I think it works

Kotlin automatic code calling in delegation pattern I am making use of the Kotlin delegation pattern to mix and match several components into bigger components  This has sped up my code  made it easier to read  more modular  more consistent etc  All good things  However  one thing I m struggling with is a good pattern to deallocate my delegates  Most of them have a method that I use to take care of unsubscribing subscriptions  canceling Android loaders  suspending execution of tasks etc  Currently  I am doing stuff like  Manually calling dispose on all delegated methods feels a bit clunky   is there an elegant way in Kotlin  via polymorphism  more delegation  etc  to make sure that a class calls certain methods of delegates automatically   in this case  it s clean up methods  but the same could be applied for any operation that all delegates need to do

Kotlin Java functional and immutable way of collecting a map in a map Currently i m reading a file through the Java API and adding items to a map through the method foreach which forces me to make use of the mutablemap  Is there a way of collecting the items without the mutablemap  I know there is a method collect but I couldn t get it working  the current way  EDIT  my goal is to merge the triple objects based on the first value of the triple  So a scenario would be two triple objects 1  2  5 5  and  1 3  5 5   The first value of the triple is the user id  the second is the article id and the third is the rating of the article  after merging there would be one single entry in the map containing the first key = the user id  the first value of the triple  and the value would be a map containing the articles which the user rated  It is currently working how I want it to work  but I was curious if there was a more functional way of solving this

Android Kotlin UI Async Http request   AsyncTask or Custom Libraries  Specifically trying do some non blocking http operations within a UI context  I read up on coroutines whicch blew my tiny mind  couldn t work out how to invoke a declarative suspend method from a UI event  Had a fair crack with AsyncTask in conjunction with URL addr  openStream    which seemed ok  but I couldn t seem find any good examples where a lambda was being passed in for the oncomplete processing  All the examples seemed to just directly name the control instances in the in the onPostExecute function  I was keen to find a more reusable pattern  perhaps in the styley of jquery s ajax pattern  The Fuel http client library seems pretty good  I ve knocked this together which seems to do the trick  So  the question  Is anyone else using other custom libs to do this   what kinda stuff are you guys using

Repeating actions on state with RxJava This is in Kotlin  but I think anyone who writes Java will be able to understand  I m trying to make a stopwatch with Rx and I m having a little trouble with doing the actual stopping and starting  The big problem is that I don t know how to keep the current time  while modifying it as different actions  starting and stopping  come in  Here s what I ve got right now  Where and are s that emit events about the current starting time to count down from and say what to do next  respectively  I want to chain off of and be able to keep state starting at that will count down when a event appears  pause when appears  and reset at when appears  almost works  but I don t know how to stop after the timer hits 0 and is still being sent every second  since it would be sending duplicate info  Also it doesn t allow a separation between the state and the observed value  So the value I accumulate with has to be the same type as the value inside the  if that makes sense   Any ideas what I should do

How do I change button text and function in Android  I am an Android beginner  Here is what I am trying to do  I have an activity UI with three buttons  A second activity is identical however the buttons text and actions are different  Rather than have it switch intents or activities when buttons are clicked on the the first activity  can I code the buttons to change when clicked  This way I wouldn t need a second identical UI  The three buttons are Login  SignUp and Tour  When Login or Tour are clicked I do indeed want them to launch different activities  But for  SignUp  this is where the UI would be identical containing the same buttons but different text and will launch different intents  My goal is to eliminate this identical UI and just have the buttons change on the first screen when  Sign Up  is clicked  Here is my current code which just launches new intents on click  I am not sure where to start to get the functionality I want  Any help is appreciated  Thanks

Android Class Not Found Intermitten and Spreading Through The Code It s been a week since I start my project using Kotlin and Android Studio  Everything seems ok until I started to get error the problem is  this error is intermittent and unclear for me  I encountered this problem first time when my google play service enabled  The class not found was a resources from google service  After I looked at stack overflow  I found out it was about multidex  I hope it was that simple  After I turned multidex on  it worked  But then the error occurred again until I turn off the google service  It work until another error occurred  After google service was turned off  the missing class now is fabric class  I m also using fabric   Then I took out all fabric library  Now the missing class is support v7 appcompat R$drawable  Weird thing is  whenever I do clean build on my project  the project smoothly  After some build  the ClassNotFoundException occurred again  I know this problem was about the class is gone from the dex file  Multidex should solve it  But still  it still occurred  Thank you in advance

Can kotlin define dynamic method when class init  My class  Function names are dynamic  Can Kotlin do this 
Higher order  or recursive   generic type parameters in kotlin I m prototyping some highly declarative code  and the type inference and safety that comes with Kotlin helps a lot  One of the goals is making extensions  subclasses  of the primary types stupidly easy to implement  In order to maintain rich type inference and expressiveness  I ve found some success in defining generic extension functions projected against subclasses  All the type information of subclass methods with none of the extra subclass implementation  it s great  So I m trying to write a rich generic function that maintains as much type information as possible  The issue creeps up with the fact that this function operates on potentially recursively generic types  and I want to shuffle the generic type parameters  This would be impossible to describe without an example  So consider  We want a function that effectively can do this  except generically Goal Criteria  Takes as a param and returns   except with different generic type parameter I d like to generalize this behavior as an extension function of all subclasses of It needs to be an extension function so that using generic types we can have the type of the subclass and ensure the argument has a generic type argument of the receiver type  Or in other words  we want an extension function for subclasses of so the argument must be instead of when invoked on That describes the gist of the problem  I m not sure the language is capable of supporting what I want  I m not sure if type erasure is a factor that makes this impossible  but so far I can t find it so  maybe I could use help if it is so   The following is close but there are a few problems It returns instead of   It would be nice if it could return and not lose type information  otherwise I don t really have a use for this function anyway  There is technically no guarantee is Thinking ahead  if something like the following was valid Kotlin  I think it would address my problem Is there a reason it can t be done  e g  added as a feature on the language  I am sympathetic to logistical reasons against  but I m curious if it is even possible in principle too  Last notes  It reminds me of type aliases except for generic type parameters themselves  In fact I ve included that keyword in the example in case it helps to digest  That isn t the only part though  notice and in the syntax  It almost reminds me of Monads as well  except with class definitions themselves if that makes sense in a sort of hand wavy  intuitive way  I have no idea how to implement the body yet  but I haven t gotten that far since I m still trying to see if the signature is even possible  p

Extending data class from a sealed class in Kotlin I have a set of data classes that share some common fields  So ideally I d like to declare those in a supertype  Message in this example   and be able to write functions that operate on the supertype if they need access to these common fields  messageId in this example   I tried to accomplish this by extending my data classes from a sealed class  Data classes may extend sealed classes  but not I m not sure how if they can accept arguments required by the  supertype  sealed class  Extending a regular class from a sealed class compiles just fine  However  changing it to a data class doesn t compile   Data class primary constructor must have only property  val var  parameters     Declaring the parameter as a property also doesn t compile    messageId  hides member of supertype  Message  and needs  override  modifier     Opening the supertype property and overriding it in each of the base classes compiles fine  Ideally I would like something close to Option 2   it allows me to combine the best of both worlds  Otherwise  it seems my options are either handrolling my own data class functionality  copy  hashcode  equals etc  with option 1  or live with a compromise by opening up up the supertype properties with option 4

Confused about RxJava variable Assignment I have a function that takes in a username String and returns whether or not the user already exists in a MongoDB database  I m new to the RxJava and Retrofit model  and I m confused about hwo to assign variables once I subscribe to the Observable object  The logs work perfectly  and all the calls execute correctly  however the userExists never changes  and stays false  I m guessing this is because of the anonymous class that I created within the subscribe method  but I still can t pin why

Android Studio 3 0 Kotlin changes are not reflected in the build Has anyone tried the new android studio with 3 0 for kotlin  I am seeing a weird issue where the Kotlin code changes are not reflected when I run the app but the java changes can be seen  When I debug the app  the code won t stop at the new lines of code  Also I ve particularly seen that during runtime Java complains that the new method that I wrote in Kotlin cannot be found  But the java code which was written at the same time can be seen  The only solution I ve found is either to rebuild the app or uninstall and reinstall  Any solutions for this problem  NB  I ve instant run OFF and also tried incremental compilation on kotlin build OFF ON
Call Kotlin object with class delegation from Java as a static method This may be a bit difficult to describe  so I ll try to give a concrete example of what I m trying to do  Suppose we have a Facade interface and class  in java   like this  In my applications  I need to have multiple singletons which hold an instance of the facade  The real facade has additional setup config parameters but those are irrelevant here  Before I started using kotlin  I would have class which held a static instance of the facade  not really a singleton  but in my case it served a similar purpose  which proxied the calls to the facade  like this  Now  with Kotlin we have class delegates which allows me to write something like this  This is great   no more boilerplate and I can call from Kotlin classes the same way I called the java   But  a slight problem arises when I use from Java  Then I have to specify   I am aware of the annotation  but the only place I can put it in the file without causing compile errors is right before and it doesn t seem to do the trick  Is there a way to set up this class delegate so that I can call it from Java as if it were a static method  without introducing the boilerplate of creating proxy methods for  which would defeat the purpose of the class delegate

Kotlin  Sorting | Location of swap operation I m implementing the Quicksort algorithm in Kotlin  For that  I created an interface  ISort  with a type parameter and a single function  sort  For sorting  I need the swap operation  I was wondering what the best location of this swap function is  My ideas  1  Unfortunately  in Kotlin one cannot make interface function protected  Thus  every class could see the swap in its implementations and that s not too nice  although it s not too bad either  I agree   2  Putting it in the QuickSort implementation is even worse because there might be several implementations of the ISort interface that need a swap function  3  My next thought was to create a singleton object but Kotlin permits objects with type parameters  Here is the interface definition  And here is the skeleton of the QuickSort class  So  from a software engineering perspective what would be the best place   location for the swap operation 
Kotlin bound callable references inconsistency Today I was creating unit tests for my Presenter in Android app and I noticed some inconsistency with bound callable references  Is it under development or is it language bug  I found that in kotlin 1 1 bound callable references are supported  But my code fails with kotlin 1 1 2 4  In my presenter class  tested method reads data from database and method have no parameters while view takes list   >   I m using Mockito  RxJava2 and Room Persistance library  I have created test for method When I have setup as above  the test passes without problems  But when I change line to Then my test fails saying Is it language bug  Because vulnerable code compiles fine and runs  it just causes the method to not be invoked at all  without any errors  To clarify  the same code written in Java 8 works fine  lambda argument is correctly passed into method reference  As you can see in Kotlin bound callable references work fine when used with methods that takes no parameters  otherwise they are not called at all

Combining Rx Singles into Observables recursively Let s say I have a called that can either emit an element from type or fail  that would be a in some languages   That is  Instances from type have a method that return an optional from type as well  a in Kotlin   This behavior leads to a chain of instances capable of emitting a chain of instances  where each single may emit an element capable of returning a next single   which will emit an element and so on  until the last element does not return a single or any of the singles fails  I m looking for an elegant way to obtain an from type capable of emitting all elements from the chain started by finishing successfully when there are no more singles on the chain or failing if any single fails  By elegant  I mean something as simple as this  in Kotlin   What s the applicability of this  This scenario can be found when consuming a REST API with pagination  where instances can be used to retrieve individual pages  which can in turn provide instances capable of emitting subsequent pages

returning the last expression in a block I am learning the new and very beautiful language Kotlin and everything seems to be very logical and consistent  I only found one thing which seems like an arbitrary exception to the rule than a solid rule  But maybe I lack enough understanding some deeper reasons behind the rule  I know that in and statements there are blocks of code  then the last expression is returned  In the next example or are returned depending on the condition   in our case it returns   On the other hand this does not hold for any code block  The next line assigns not to but to the whole block of code as a lambda  Similarly in function body  the last expression is not returned  This does not even compile  So what exactly is the rule  Is it really so arbitrary like  if in or statement which is used as expression there is a block of code  then the last expression in the block is returned  Otherwise the last expression is not returned to outer scope  Or am I missing something

Initializing a RecyclerView with Android Data Binding in Kotlin is throwing an error  What am I doing wrong  Description I am trying to set up an Android screen in Kotlin with a RecyclerView using android data binding  I have an activity that contains a fragment and the fragment contains a RecyclerView that I initialize with data binding  The issue is that when I try to set my recycler view s layout manager the application throws an IllegalStateException complaining that the specified child  I m assuming it means either the RecyclerView or the LayoutManager  already has a parent and that I need to run removeView    I have tried removing all views from the RecyclerView  but to no avail  Here is my activity  Here is my fragment  And here is my fragment layout  When I try to run this  I get an error on my recyclerview when I try to set the LayoutManager  So my question is  What am I doing wrong  Am I using data binding incorrectly  Is Kotlin just not playing well with data binding  Any help or feedback would be appreciated  Edit  Here is the full stack trace for the error  06 14 21 34 44 876 3631 3631 com kinler mtgutility E AndroidRuntime  FATAL EXCEPTION  main Process  com kinler mtgutility  PID  3631 java lang IllegalStateException  The specified child already has a parent  You must call removeView   on the child s parent first  at android view ViewGroup addViewInner ViewGroup java 4885  at android view ViewGroup addView ViewGroup java 4716  at android view ViewGroup addView ViewGroup java 4656  at android support v7 widget RecyclerView$5 addView RecyclerView java 751  at android support v7 widget ChildHelper addView ChildHelper java 107  at android support v7 widget RecyclerView$L
named functions vs lambda reflexion I am still learning Kotlin and trying to understand its core principles  What I do not get is this  we get the following output  My question is why the output is not the same  I believed these functions should be interchangeable  equivalent   I think the type of all the functions should be   Why do we keep the original name with the function signature    even though it is assigned to a different name     Is there any language design principle which would require such difference in function signatures  And a bonus question   why do we need to use the operator   It does not compile without it  But why is this required by the language design  Would not work just fine and be much simpler

Null safety in legacy Java libraries used in Kotlin pojects Let s say I have particular code in old legacy Java library  The first two parameters are properly annotated with  NotNull and  Nullable annotations  using jetbrains annotations   The third one  unnanotatedString  is left without proper annotation  When I use this class in my Kotlin code and set all the constructor arguments to non null values  everything is fine  The first value is non null so I can access it without a safe call  Second value and I need to use safe call  nullableString  length   if not  I have a compile time error  so far so good  On the third value  unannotatedString  I can use it without a safe call  it compiles fine  But when I set the third parameter to  null  I don t get a compile time error  no safe call required  only runtime NullPointerException  Is that expected behaviour  Is Kotlin s compiler treating not annotated Java methods same as the ones annotated with  NotNull

overloading + and += operators for  Number Classes  I want to create extension functions for classes that encapsulate simple s  For example   I encountered the problem  that I can t overload the and the operator at the same time  I wan t to create a behaviour  that passes following tests  It could be implemented using these extension functions  The problem is  that if is overlodaded the can t be overloaded aswell  If I only overload the operator  a new object is returned on operations instead of the initial one  Is there a way to work around this limitation 
Launch overlay activity without showing the rest of the app I currently have an app composed of multiple activities  one of which is a translucent one  The app has notifications  and when I tap it  I want it to open the translucent activity on top of whatever is currently on the screen  As of now  this works if my app is closed  but if it is running and my overlay activity opens  the rest of my app is also in the foreground  I d like to make it so that only the overlay is there  and once the user presses back  it will go back to their original app  This sort of mimics google chrome s tab activity  I am currently launching my activity through a PendingIntent  Those flags are what I have when I launch the activity elsewhere  but they don t seem to affect this pending intent  As mentioned  this activity is translucent and draws over other activities  I feel like this involves me separating this activity from the rest of the app tasks  but I also use the overlay within my app and am not sure if that will affect anything  Any ideas  Edit 1  Here is the activity manifest

Kotlin sealed class subclass needs to be casted to base class if provided as RxJava Observable I m trying to avoid terminal states of RxJava chains in my app written in Kotlin  so I found out that it is right thing to transform to where is sealed class  And let s say I have this network request observable  So what I want to do in the end is to handle result like this  Everything should work great  but I have this error in IDE  Isn t it just simple using of subclass instead of base class  I found out that if I explicitly cast to everything works  but shows this warning  Why it even happens and what am I doing wrong here  UPD  It looks like the main issue here is near rxjava s onErrorReturn operator  If I remove it completely  then it works even without keyword like answers suggest  If I return from both map and onErrorReturn then keyword helps to get rid of errors  But if I return from onErrorReturn there s still error  Compiler has to know that typed with the same as   What should I do to avoid it or to satisfy it s requirements

Bridge design pattern resulting in too many generics I m currently working on something for Minecraft  and I m using the bridge pattern so my code can used with two separate server platforms  Sponge and Bukkit  with different  but somewhat similar  API s  I have my core code  which depends only on abstractions of common things in Minecraft that I will need later on  such as players and items  as well as abstract factory and builder classes  The code for the specific server platforms will implement the factories and builders  and provide them as dependencies to the core code  This has been working pretty well so far  but I m running into an issue with abstractions that depend on each other  For example  I have adapters for Minecraft inventories and items that adapt from the server platform s item inventory type  to my own abstract item inventory type  Item and inventory objects will need to interact with each other  and since the core code doesn t know about the implementation  I ve resorted to using generics  Here s some pseudocode  The Item class adapts an item from the item type used by the server platform  The method implementations will use the method to add an instance of the server platform s item to an instance of the server platform s inventory  Overall  generics provide a solution to interaction between platform specific objects  The problem I ve been running into  however  is generics getting complicated as the size of the project increases  One reason is that classes that use items inventories will require the same generics  For example  all players have an inventory  And something that uses a player needs to have generics  and so forth  The second issue is that there are more interactions between instances than just these two  which could mean several generic parameters for an object  and therefore more generics on all the classes that use that object  I suppose another solution would be not using generics at all  changing to return an type  and blindly cast  trusting that it s the correct type  which it will be   I ve put a ton of thought into this  and this is about the best I could come up with  I m wondering if there are any other solutions that I m missing  or any design patterns that might help with this problem  If having the source would help  you can find it here

What does    mean in Kotlin when used on the left side of an assignment  According to the Kotlin docs  the    operator represents a  safe call   meaning that if it s used in a chain of method calls  the entire chain will return null if the value of whatever it s used on is null  But what about if it s used on the left side of an assignment  Since the left side isn t the side that s  returning  anything it seems like it probably has a different effect  Here s an example of what I m talking about

Why is getMessage   an unresolved reference in Kotlin with an Exception class  Kotin documentation says that  All exception classes in Kotlin are descendants of the class Throwable  Every exception has a message  stack trace and an optional cause   The Java documentation for Throwable shows a getMessage   method  But the Kotlin documentation for Throwable does not have a getMessage    So this code  gives me this compile error  suggesting that I am using a Kotlin Exception class derived from a Kotlin Throwable class  However  if I change getMessage   to toString   and add a throw  I get this message  Which seems to say that the Exception class is NOT a Kotlin Exception class   but the java version which has a getMessage   method and I shouldn t get a compile error when I try to use it

Coding convention for empty functions that need to be overridden in Kotlin Accourding to the very short Coding Conventions there is no answer for the opimal way of writing down empty functions in Kotlin  Example  Here only one of the 3 necessary Methods of AnimationListener  Android  is used  Which type of empty Method should be used  Single Expression    or the traditional way used in Java     I personally like the  Way more because that seems to be meant the way of shorting functions down to one line  But is shorter yet older and probably more ugly  And is there any better shorter way for doing this code

Implementation of a  valve  for Observable streams  including buffering the last element emmitted before the valve reopened I m trying to wrap my head around how to implement something in RxJava  2 0   It s for Android and I m using Kotlin  although the choice of platform and language shouldn t matter here  The idea is that I d base some sort of MVP architecture on RxJava  In this implementation I m thinking about an  could be a or a custom as well  exposes a stream of values  s for simplicity  which indicate lifecycle events  or whether the view is attached or detached  The underlying idea is basically this  And then from the other end  the Presenter exposes an that is a stream of objects representing screen states   to be rendered by the View   This follows the concept explained in this series    which boils down to the fact that the Presenter feeds the View with standalone objects encapsulating screen states in their entirety rather than multiple different methods on the View   And then I d like to bind these two observable streams so that  Whenever the View gets detached  input from the Presenter is disregarded  and it s not buffered  so as not to run into any backpressure problems  However  once the View gets reattached  it picks up the latest state the Presenter emmitted  In other words  only one state instance is to be buffered at most  It would work as follows  assuming the states are of type for simplicity   I m not sure what the best  idiomatic solution is  I tried to implement it as an   but I couldn t quite get it right  I believe the transformer should be stateless  whereas my solution gravitated towards explicitly keeping track of what was emmitted and buffering the last element  manually  etc   which feels messy and too imperative  so I suppose it s wrong  I found  but the implementation looks very complex and I can t believe it couldn t be done in a simpler manner  I don t need all the flexibility  I only want something that works for the described usecase   Any insights would be appreciated  including whether there s something else I should take into consideration still  within the context of Android  Also note that I don t use RxKotlin bindings  I may  I just didn t suppose they should be required here   EDIT  Below is my current implementation  As I said  I m not too happy about it because it s explicitly stateful  and I believe this should be achieved declaratively  leveraging some constructs of RxJava  I needed to merge two streams of different types  and because nor didn t quite do it  I resorted to a trick  creating a common wrapper for both distinct type of events  It introduces certain overhead again  sealed class Eventclass StateEvent val state  String   Event  class LifecycleEvent val attached  Boolean   Event  class ValveTransformer val v

Is there a way to deploy backend  Kotlin  server application to Firebase  I have already written a backend server application  which executes rather complicated tasks in Kotlin and it is running fine on my local machine  I looked into Firebase and found out that you could host your website and create your database  My server application is basically a database  plus everything to handle it  I think that it should be possible to write the same database with Firebase s database too  but I think that that would require quite some time and I would need to learn how to access the database from Android and also understand how the Firebase database works and how to implement my functionality  Concluding My question basically is  if it is possible to deploy my already written app to Firebase and access it like before  Maybe through the website hosting and a link to my Kotlin app  I could not really find any information on how to do something like this

Is it possible to use High order functions with optional arguments I put together a dummy problem to illustrate my point  Say that we have the following handy function to display information about a particular sorting algorithm  You would use it like this  And this works because the signature of is simple  But say I have another sorting algorithm with the following signature The last two arguments are optional  so in theory you could call the same way you call   That is to say  it stil respects the signature Right  Unfortunately when I try to call I get  I think that the compiler isn t being smart enough to realise that those two arguments are optional  How can avoid this problem  other than overloading the method to accept a high order function with the signature

What is the editor magic behind Kotlin Android Extensions for Views  When I add an import of the form to a Kotlin source it alters the behavior of the Android Studio editor  Specifically  it now considers any property of type to have a property corresponding to each view in the layout file that is assigned an id  I am assuming that I am doing this in a class that is not an or   For example  say I have a declared in the source file and I add a property to it called of type   Further  say that I have a layout named that has three view declarations that have been assigned the ids      and   When I add a synthetic import of the form above with a layout name of suddenly has three new properties      and   Or  more correctly  the editor makes it appear as though has these properties  After some research  I have concluded the following  The addition of layout view ids as properties is done blindly  Any view id implied by a such a synthetic import is added to any property of the class that is of type  or a subclass of    This includes properties of such type inherited by the class  Because the properties are added blindly it is incumbent upon the developer to ensure that the runtime view corresponding to the synthetic import is assigned before the synthetic properties are accessed or an exception will be thrown  If two or more such imports are specified in a file then the union of their view ids will be blindly added to all class properties of type   The purpose of allowing multiple imports is to account for the case where one layout file includes another  Are these conclusions correct  Are any other interesting subtleties around the implementation of this feature  I am using version 1 1 2 5 of the kotlin gradle plugin 
How to implement exponentially decreasing weighted average I ve been trying to implement a weighted average function using exponentially decreasing weights as described in this Wikipedia article  I think I m failing  I m a bit too thick to fill in a few of the gaps that seem to be missing from the Wikipedia article  since it seems to be missing a nice clean one line definition of what the function should produce given m samples  ie what does f x1  x2      xm  =    Here s my attempt to implement it in Kotlin  where numbers contains my m samples  and fraction is the Δ referred to in the Wikipedia article  But I m pretty sure this is wrong  because  eg  I expect to produce the output 1  but it ends up spitting out 0 27125    which rounds down to zero  Can you help me correct my implementation  hopefully explaining what wrong assumption or step I made

Android Conductor  How to retain state of views of orientation changes I am currently learning about the Conductor framework for Android and have a bit of a problem or misunderstanding of how it works  I was under the impression that the method would save the states of the views in the controller  To test the behaviour  I added EditText views  entered a value in it and rotated the screen  I also added 2 views with onclick listeners attached  changing the background color onclick The result of the test was that the EditText views maintained the state and preserved the entered values  But the 2 views  changed back to their original background color  none   This is the behaviour of the views regardless on which RetainViewMode is set I have this simple MainActivity  note  I m writing in Kotlin   And here is the the TestController  And xml layout file controller layout test  < xml version= 1 0  encoding= utf 8  ><FrameLayout xmlns android=     android layout width= match parent     android layout height= match parent >    <requestFocus>< requestFocus>    <ImageView        android layout width= match parent         android layout height= match parent         android src=  drawable logo simple  >    <ScrollView        android layout width= match parent         android layout height= match parent >        <LinearLayout            android layout width= 300dp             android layout height= wrap content             android orientation= vertical             android layout margin= 30dp             android layout gravity= center             android background=  color transparent50p             android padding= 20dp >            <EditText                android id=  +id gt                 android layout width= match parent                 android layout height= 40dp                 android layout gravity= center                 android layout marginTop= 10dp                 android padding= 6dp                 android background=  color white transparent50p  >                 >            <EditText                android id=  +id erergeargf                 android layout width= match parent                 android layout height= 40dp                 android layout gravity= center                 android layout marginTop= 10dp                 android padding= 6dp                 android background=  color white transparent50p  >            <View                android id=  +id a                 android layout width= 50dp                 android layout height= 50dp

Combining mandatory and arbitrary optional constructor arguments with Groovy I am trying to determine  purely out of interest  whether it is possible to completely remove the need to use the Builder pattern in Groovy by using named and default constructor arguments  that is  to solve the telescoping constructor problem using only the built in language features  For example  in Kotlin  it is possible to do the following  This yields the following output  The line of particular interest is where  yields Note that I was able to set optional2 without having had to set optional1  I am not sure this is possible in Groovy but  then again  I am far from expert  As a point of interest  looking at the generated byte code  the Kotlin compiler appears to generate a single constructor and then rewrites the instantiation statements to pass the optional arguments at the correct point in the argument list  So  to the Groovy experts  is this simply not possible in Groovy or am I yet to find the correct syntax  Thanks in advance  Simon

Why is the first computation in my Android app slow while all subsequent computations are fast I m using the symja android library to perform mathematical calculations for a quiz app I m building  All of my calculations are performed by passing in a string such as  1+3 +  4 2   to a class within the library called ExprEvaluator    A sample usage would be When I run my quiz app and answer a question for the first time  the main UI Thread would freeze as it performed the calculation  but all subsequent calculations would be incredibly fast  Below  I have outlined a bunch of strategies I tried in order to solve the problem  Note  I have injected the ExprEvaluator class with Dagger  and it exists as a singleton Strategy 1  Offload the computation to a seperate thread Result  Didn t make a difference in initial computation time and actually resulted in more issues because I needed the result on the main UI Thread  All subsequent computations were fast as usual  Strategy 2  Run a simple initial computation on my SplashScreen Activity  Result  This is the best possible solution I have found yet but the only drawback is that my splash screen takes too long  Once inside the main app  the quiz performs very well  Strategy 3  Run on a new Thread inside the Splash screen activity Result  This solved the problem of the splash screen taking way too long to load but if I answer a question on the main thread and check it s correctness before other thread s initial computation is complete  the UI thread freezes  I noticed that the first call to evaluate would always be slow  no matter the string I pass in  I could pass in  1  and the evaluation would take around 4 seconds while all subsequent more complex evaluations take miliseconds at most  Even if I use a new instance of the ExprEvaluator class for every sincle computation like so  I still get a slow initial computation and all subsquent calls to evaluate are lightning fast  I m not really sure what s happening here  and I m wondering if it s a native android issue where heavy computation needs to performed at least once for all subsequent calculations to be smooth

Is there a better way to write CompletableFutrue XXXasync   invocations in kotlin  Java has a lot of async methods  static or instance  in this format If you have enough experience with FP in kotlin  you will immediately realize these function are extremely awkward to use in kotlin  because the SAM interface is not the last parameter  That has a very very long generic signature that I don t know how to let IDE generate  It will be a plain in the butt if the type name become even longer or contains a ParameterizedType or has type variance annotations  It also looks nasty because of the trailing on line 5  Is there some missing functionality in kotlin or IDE that can help with the situation  At least I don t want to write that long SAM constructor all by myself  Rejected solutions  Using named parameter doesn t seem to work because this feature only works on a kotlin function  Abandon async methods sounds bad from the very beginning  Kotlin corountine is rejected because we are working with some silly Java libraries that accept only 
Lambda type with unknown number of arguments I have created a map that will store functions to be called at a later time  its type looks like this  The thing is  I don t know how many parameters each function being stored has  or the types of those parameters  Currently the map type will only let me store functions that have no parameters and a return type of Unit  How do I represent a function type that will let me store functions with an unknown number of parameters and an unknown return type  but it still has to be a function that is stored  Something like this is what I m looking for  How do I represent that kind of function type in Kotlin

How to convert transform a collection to another collection by element s property  If I have a collection of an object in Kotlin  is there a quick way to get a collection of a certain property of those objects  I looked at a list of collection operations for Kotlin  but nothing stood out for me  but I may have overlooked something  In python it would be akin to  And I d prefer to use a collections function instead of doing  I m pretty lacking in knowledge of filtering lambda functions and anything other than list comprehension  so apologies if this is a simple question

Annotate getter from the property In kotlin  we can define which will have a getter and a setter  It s easy to remove the setter by changing it to   but what if we have a property that should only have the setter and no getter  Is there any way to create an annotation that we can apply to that will deprecate the getter so others cannot use it  The end goal is to be able to use the property syntax rather than call Current workaround I am aware of that achieves a similar result  I would like to know if it s possible to define something similar to

Kotlin  function delegation I have a project that depends heavily on delegation and composition in Kotlin  Delegating properties is a breeze  but conceptually I m not completely sure how to achieve delegation for functions in circumstances where the functions depend on other composed properties  I d like to do something like this  Of course  this type of thing would be achievable with the following  but this feels clunky as it requires passing in objects for composition which bloats the size of the constructors   it would be cleaner for me to initialize the objects at the site of the class itself as they have no use outside of the class  Is there an elegant way to this with delegation and or extensions

Why is casting the type still necessary even though it has already been assured in this example  Today I came across this section in the Kotlin Docs  Called  smart casts   Kotlin seems to  insert  safe  casts automatically when needed   I don t understand what  smart casting  does in this example  There seems to be nothing that requires casting  as will always be String and thus will always work  no casting required  What is happening on the line exactly  Thanks in advance

What is the correct way to add a abstract private getter and a public setter  I have a interface where i want a property that can be modified innside the class  but not outside  I cannot use val because it needs to be mutable and the var keyword can not have a specified private setter since this is in a interface  In java i would have done this  I can use the same approach in kotlin and just write the getter function dirrectly  but this does not seem like a kotlinlike approach  Is there a better way to achive the same as this  fun getMyProperty

Change Navigation drawer item color filter also change the imageView which is use same image id In the app have Navigation drawer contains a lot of menu items  The limitation is  there is one item will show its color instance of tint color but the other show tint  With this limitation  I decided to use the color filter to handle the icon color stage of the item drawer  This path work perfectly fine  And my menu looks like this  Every menu expect the main menu should show color state like this selected  blue not selected  gray Main menu selected  show its color not selected  gray And the code to handle the state look like this The problem is If I use imageView and set drawable as same as one of the menu item  The color state will change following the menu item  I don t want to change the tint color of the imageView  But it changes according to the menu item  Then I add tint color in imageView to change to different thin color but it still shows the same color of the menu  For example  In this case  imageView should show only black color  But it show gray or blue according to the menu  The expecting result is the imageView should tint color from the color I set in the XML But the result is it shown the same tint color like the menu item  I think it independently  can someone explains why this issue happened and how to fix it In the project use data binding and Kotlin

What is the right approach to  This AsyncTask class should be static or leaks might occur  in Kotlin Android  There are many questions here dealing with in java android  This Handler class should be static or leaks might occur  IncomingHandler This Handler class should be static or leaks might occur AsyncQueryHandler This AsyncTask class should be static or leaks might occur  anonymous android os AsyncTask  The warning is due to the fact that inner class holds an implicit reference to the outer class  and hence preventing the outer class from GC d  The solution lies in the warning itself that the class should be declared static  However  the solution is java specific  Given that kotlin has no modifier  the closest thing is companion object and companion object does hold reference to it s  outer class   Below are my  failed  attempts with remarks Are the assertion about attempt2 and attempt3 correct that even without the linter warning  the code is still leaking  What options do we have to avoid the leaking  Should I resolve to plain old top level with a member of to callback

How to obtain all subclasses of a given sealed class  Recently we upgraded one of our enum class to sealed class with objects as sub classes so we can make another tier of abstraction to simplify code  However we can no longer get all possible subclasses through function  which is bad because we heavily rely on that functionality  Is there a way to retrieve such information with reflection or any other tool  PS  Adding them to a array manually is unacceptable  There are currently 45 of them  and there are plans to add more  This is how our sealed class looks like  If there is an values collection  it will be in this shape  Naturally no one wants to maintain such a monster

Kotlin SAM Runtime Error  NoSuchMethodError  No static method Today I ran into a really strange runtime error while developing kotlin   android that involves SAM conversions and sub classing  Here s a minimal example of pure java + kotlin  Here are two java classes  And here is a kotlin main function  This code compiles fine but at run time I get the following error  Now  this is already bad    if code like this does not work  it never will I guess  the compiler should raise an error  But at least one could say that it is bad idea to reference to the interface via the subclass instead of the place of definition  i e      It s less clear though  if this code is in a sub class of where I can reference directly using   So my questions would be  Why is this behavior happening at all  If it is happening  why is the compiler not raising an error already  PS  In android the error message looks similar to this  which is even more confusing

Kotlin   Why is this function ineligible for tail recursion  The function in the following example calls itself recursively  It can be re written so that the last operation performed is the recursive call to itself  Yet  if I mark it as a function  I get a warning that the recursive call is not a tail call  This doesn t stop compilation of the successful running of the program  However  why is this not a tail call  The documentation says  This is not within a try catch finally block and there is no more code after the recursive call  What is it that means this code block is ineligible for tail recursion optimisation  I ll take a stab at answering my own question  in that it has no return value  Based on this discussion  that s about all I can think of  Thoughts

Kotlinic pattern for using Spring Data JPA s  query by example  Spring Data JPA introduces a nice feature   query by example   QBE   You express your search criteria by constructing an instance of the entity  You do not have to write JPQL  It uses less  magic  than does repository query derivation  The syntax is nice  It prevents explosions of trivial repository code  It survives refactors very well  There s a problem though  QBE only works if you can partially construct an object  Here s my entity  Here s my repository  empty  this is a nice thing about QBE   And here s how you would fetch a   all the products that are sold in some shop  in some city  Or at least  that s what I want to do  There s a problem  It s not possible to construct this object  This is because  s constructor requires that all its fields be defined  And indeed  that s what I want most of the time  The usual compromise in Java would be  construct entities using no args constructor  make everything mutable  have no guarantees about completedness  Is there a nice Kotlin pattern to solve this problem  generally require that all args are instantiated on construction provide also some mechanism to produce partially constructed instances for use with Example API Admittedly these look like totally conflicting goals  But maybe there s another way to approach this  For example  maybe we can make a mock proxy object  which appears to be a Product  but doesn t have the same construction constraints

Can I invoke the Kotlin noargs plugin from the command line or from Ant  Kotlin has a noarg compiler plugin which can be used to generate synthetic no argument constructors for specially annotated classes  The documentation page clearly explains how to use it with Maven and Gradle  but it is not clear whether it can be used  or how to use it  either from Ant or using on the command line  So far I ve been unable to make it work  Here s my source file  And here are some command lines I ve tried  which have no effect at all  and  When I run there is no evidence of a generated no args constructor  There s some side evidence that the plugin isn t running at all  as well  in the fact that if I put garbage instead of the word annotation for the  P option  there s no error message or change in behaviour  If you can tell me how to get it to run using or from Ant  I d really appreciate it

Eclipse   How to add Kotlin to a Tomcat Project   Compile Kotlin AND Java Files I need help adding Kotlin compiling to an existing eclipse java tomcat project  For the record I am on Eclipse Oxygen 4 7  and have installed the Kotlin plugin  I have successfully created and ran gradle based spring boot Kotlin rest api demo and can compile and run  Kotlin Only Projects  and use my other java libs   AWESOME  However now that I have Kotlin I want to use it in work for my other  legacy  Tomcat 8 projects that are Java J2EE   Dynamic WTP     new servlets I want to write in Kotlin  I want to be able to add a Kotlin class in the java src folder in any of my previous packages so when I build a war it all logically together  The IDE seems ok with this   I created a Kotlin class in a package  in a tomcat project java src package folder  and it have no issues on resolving  imports  or dependency    I was thinking WOW   Ok now to restart the Tomcat server in WTP and I ll be able to execute my Kotlin Servlet  No   404 404 404  I inspected the WEB INF classes build folder and along all the Java class files    guess what I saw   A file called KotlinServlet kt   thats the name of my test servlet  the source version not a compile class version  So for some reason the build  package  deployment did not bother to compile the   kt file and just copied it over  maybe that is the default for general WTP deploy   I wonder if this would be solved by  Add Kotlin Nature    the strange part is that none of the eclipse Kotlin menu functions are available to me  If I right click my project I get no Kotlin menu options  Eclipse states the plugin is installed  So my question is  Given an existing conventional WTP Tomcat servlet project  HOW can we get it to identify and a compile   kt files  How and why do I not have the Kotlin menu functions   I downloaded and tested both the Oxygen Java and J2EE version   installed the Kotlin plugin   and no menus there either to add a Kotlin Nature  I also then tried the nightly build of the plugin  No menus appeared  Obviously the puglin is installed compiling other Kotlin projects and works in the editor  From my research    Add Kotlin Nature  is supposed to do the trick for joint Java   Kotlin compiling but that menu function is not available anywhere    If this is a  Kotlin Project  eclipse compiles Kotlin fine  Any Ideas  Seems like an IntelliJ conspiracy  Thanks

Using functional interfaces with function types in Kotlin When calling Java code from Kotlin  there is SAM conversion so that Java code like this  Can look like this  Now  I m working on a Kotlin project and I want to define a functional interface as an event listener  In I have a function to set the listener  And when I create an instance of this class and try to invoke the setter function  I do it like so  I m aware that Kotlin has function types therefore doesn t support SAM conversion from various sites such as this one  I ve read a little about function types but I have not used them before  How would I rewrite my code so that I can invoke the setter function like this

Robolectric test and LiveData To get a hang of Kotlin  LiveData and Robolectric alltogether  I got a simple splash screen activity  It works properly when running the application  but it fails to work in the test  It is like the live data s callback is never triggered or like if no oberver is registered for it  Here is the test  The activity  The view model  which gets mocked anyway  so implementation is not used  
Animating  scrolling  one ViewGroup blocks unrelated Views from animation until finished View hierarchy  Goal  I need to slide in  using fast out slow in interpolator  last View  which happens to be custom toolbar  in my hierarchy when is scrolled suffiently high and slide it out when is suffiently low  Effect similar to sliding title header at  Problem  Toolbar s animations    view is initially hidden  to show  and hide it  The problem is that animations won t run until  s scrolling stops  key up   I suspect animations are queued in FIFO somehow and pending until scrolling stops  I don t understand why that may be the case since two views are completely independent and is below my Toolbar  The Twist This works perfectly fine  i e  animation is fired right away  maybe it s equivalent to    So  what is happening here exactly

Divide google vision frame into two In my custom detector I want to divide image from frame into halves  to process them separately  This is what I got so far in my custom   So far  I am using the same detector on both  this is actually to check if I m going to recognise more results than in whole frame   as stupid as it sounds  but I leave the question as is  because perhaps someone in the future would need to take one part of image to be processed by one detector  and another one by another   Still  the problem is  I get the same results for both halves and actually the same as from the original frame  What do I do wrong

Android Studio 3 0 Databinding reference code not genereted by android studio I m having problem with Android Studio 3 0 and combination of kotlin and data binding  I m not sure why  but option Settings  > Editor  > Data Binding  > Reference code generated by android studio is not working as it should be  I ve tried it on different AS 3 0 versions  Canary 3  Canary 5  Canary 6  with different kotlin  1 1 2 3  1 1 3  1 1 3 2  and databinding compiler ver  To be sure I have even created clean project and the same problem occurs  I m sure that the problem lies in kotlin and databinding combination because in the same project databinding in java class is working just fine  files generated by databinding are updated with every change in  xml file  I m not going to paste my every gradle content file here because I have tried a lot of combination versions of kotlin and data binding  Below is one of them  I ve noticed that while i m in java file after click  ctrl + click  on file generated by Data binding ex  activity main xml  > ActivityMainBinding java my screen is being moved directly to activity main xml file  After the same action in Kotlin class screen is being moved to ActivityMainBinding java file  It s very annoying problem becasue with every change in  xml file I m forced to rebuild project in order to use data binding  Any kind of help or information will be appreciated EDIT  Invalidate caches   restart helps only to first project build  If I create new  xml layout it s working fine until project build

seekToEnd of all partitions and survive automatic rebalancing of Kafka consumers When a Kafka consumer of consumer group A connects to the Kafka broker I would like to seek to the end of all partitions  even if an offset is stored on the broker side  If more additional consumers are connecting for the same consumer group they should pickup the latest stored offsets  I am doing the following  The problem is when I connect the first consumer c1 of consumer group A everything works as expected  if I connect an additional consumer c2 of consumer group A  the group is rebalancing and c1 will consume the skipped offsets  Any ideas

Is it possible to use Kotlin in Grails  Some basic facts that lead me to this question  Groovy has complete Java interoperability Kotlin has complete Java interoperability Kotlin also compiles down to Java Is it therefore possible to write Kotlin code in a Grails application  I ve worked quite a bit with Grails 2 x  and recently at a new job I have been working with Kotlin  Spring  and Struts  I really like the null safety and type inference features of Kotlin  and the functional programming features of Kotlin feel much more natural and easy to use than in Groovy  this last part is pure opinion   Is it possible to use Grails to handle things like  ORM Mapping requests to controllers actions JSP GSP view parsing rendering but use Kotlin to write the actual logic of the domain classes  controller actions  services  object factories  etc  Probably not likely  because I m guessing that some of the core functionality of Grails is made possible by dynamic typing  but maybe it could be possible through either a Gradle plugin or a direct Grails plugin  I like the extreme simplicity provided by the convention over configuration paradigm of Grails  but I much prefer the static typing and type inference of Kotlin  If I could write business logic in Kotlin in a Grails environment  that  to me  would be the ultimate web application framework

Kotlin constructor properties and calling different superclass constructors I d like to use a kotlin data class as an exception  which seems fine  I d also like to be able to pass in a to the super class in those cases where one exists  Unfortunately  data classes can only have   in their primary constructor  and since the default constructor calls the no args constructor  it seems that I simply cannot do this without always requiring to be passed  and stored as a field in my class  which I don t want  What I want is something like this  It seems that even if I don t use a data class  I still can t use the convenient   constructor helpers  since they can only be on a primary constructor which must chose which super constructor to use  The best I can come up with is this  which is quite verbose  Am I missing something  Is there really no way of conditionally calling a different super class constructor based on overloaded constructors and still being able to use the   parameter syntax  If so  why  Are there better ways of doing this sort of thing 
Mutate string from an extension I was trying to port a Swift script to Kotlin but it s not working as expected  what the code does is to consume a string while the condition is true  need it for a parser   In Swift it works as expected but in Kotlin it doesn t  I just started with Kotlin a month ago so maybe I m missing something   Swift Kotlin So the basic usage will look like Edit  Thanks for all the answers  don t know if will be possible to do like I want because as mentioned string are immutable in Kotlin Java  just using the same string   I forgot to mention that I need the consumed string  basically b c I m doing a parser so I need to store the consumed chars and the mutated string  I will leave open this question but I ended up creating a class that implements only a few String class methods  Usage example

Rebase method intercept  completely overriding method I m trying to do some runtime code changing using ByteBuddy  The problem that I ve run into is that when I try to rebase a method to add an intercept call at the end  the entire method gets replaced and there isn t any $original   method declared and called after  This is the code I m using for the proper transformation clazz and dataFolder are defined above this and aren t the source of the problem  This is the signature of the injector method  In analyzing the code it outputs  the class is identical to pre transformation  but all the code that was getting called in the onEnable method has been removed  and replaced with the single method delegate  Is there a way  using a method like this  for me to keep the existing method body  but add a delegate call to the head of the method

Using Glide to cache webview images I d like to use Glide to manage the image resources of my webview  mainly so that I can reuse them later in other views  I ve set up a redirect by intercepting image resource loads and returning the following   Ultimately  I create a future loader and use that to cache and return the image as an input stream  However  this method is significantly slower than the webview s native method  ~5s vs ~8s   This may partly be because Glide has to confirm with the ui thread with each request to make sure that the view is valid before proceeding with the load  Is there anything that I can do to improve the loading process   I d also like to verify that starts loading the resources immediately rather than waiting for to be called on the future target  but I haven t found a way to add a listener yet and don t see it in the docs

Detect Back Button Press in Android View I am writing a game app that uses a ChessClock class  Each of the two players has a clock  The clocks send themselves a stream of messages every tenth of a second  and if running  decrement the time remaining  When the time expires the clock calls a method in the parent view group that stops the clocks and sets a flag that causes further touch events to be ignored so that the users can no longer move the pieces  I am writing in kotlin  but I think this will be clear to a java programmer also  This works fine  but if the user presses the back button and then starts a new game  the clocks apparently keep running  even though the activity s onDestroy method has been called  Then when the running clock expires  the new game is frozen even though the new clocks are still running  I m new to android and I don t understand how this comes about  I would have thought that the clocks would be destroyed when the activity was  I ve tested my ideas about what is happening with log messages  and have confirmed that the clocks run after onDestroy are called  I ve also overridden onDetachedFromWindow to stop the clocks  and it makes the problem go away  but this is overkill  It will also stop the clock if the user gets a phone call  won t it  and this is not what I want  Can you suggest how to best accomplish what I want  There is no way to access the clocks from the activity is there  I ve thought of emitting some event in onDestroy  and having the ChessClock listen for it  but I don t know how to write custom events and listeners yet  Is there an easier way

Kotlin reified type parameter can t be used as type parameter in body of function A reified type parameter in Kotlin prevents type parameter erasure and allows the type parameter to be known at run time  This allows the following code to compile and run as expected  However  when I try to use  T  as a type parameter instead of standalone I get a message that it is an erased type  This is demonstrated by the following code that is for illustrative purposes only  Is this due to a technical limitation  If so  what is that limitation

Disable META INF   generation in gradle android library kotlin project Good day  I ve written a kotlin android library and uploaded it on bintray  But when I try to use it  via gradle compile  in some project  it fails to build with following errors  I ve looked up both of these  jar files and they both contained folder with file  But more importantly generated  aar  android archive published in bintray  contained this folder as well as this file  I ve checked other decent bintray android libraries and they don t seem to include any files  However those that do include it  in most cases they contain license files  produce the same and the way to resolve it is to explicitly exclude them in use project s gradle file  What s the use of this file and how can I disable its generation during publishing  Because I don t want to explicitly exclude from every project which is using this library and I don t want to ask other developers to do so  Here s the library s repo   And it s bintray repo

Why can a use block not safely initialize a var  Why does this give a compile error  Maybe the compiler just sees as a function that is passed to another function and has no knowledge about when or even if it will be executed  But since is not just a function but Kotlin s replacement for Java s try with resource  some special knowledge about it would be appropriate  wouldn t it  Right now  I am forced to initialize with some dummy value  which is not in the spirit of Kotlin at all

How to remove duplicate entries from FragmentManager  I have a simple activity with a   I m using fragments to implement the contents of the activity for the different pages  When the user presses the back button  it s supposed to go back to the previously looked at page  The problem is  when you repeatedly switch back and forth between the pages  fragments   this entire history is recorded  Take this example  A  > B  > A  > B  > C  > A  > C Pressing the back button would result in the reverse  but instead I want this behaviour  I noticed it in the Instagram app   C  > A  > B  > Exit App So every fragment should only have one entry in the backstack  How do I do this  I do I remove the previous transactions for a fragment from the stack  Is this at all possible using a FragmentManager  Or do I have to implement my own  My Activity with the BottomNavigationView

Retrofit 2 RequestBody Content Length Greater Than File Size I have an Api which requires me to send up the size of a file in bytes before I then send up the actual file  When I call on the file to send up in the first Api call  it returns   When I then package the file up into a the becomes   The server then rejects this  saying that these sizes must match  Here is the code for creating the   What is being added in the to increase its content length  Should I just send up the size of the on the first call to get around this problem  EDIT Here is where I call the API the first time to send the size initially  And then this is where I call it the second time when the file actually gets uploaded  It turns out the of the is correct  So the must be being modified or increased when the is called 
Why the variable can t be initialized correctly in inline function as in java  We know the lambda body is lazily well  because if we don t call the lambda the code in the lambda body is never be called  We also know in any function language that a variable can be used in a function lambda even if it is not initialized  such as javascript  ruby  groovy and  etc  for example  the groovy code below can works fine  We also know we can access an uninitialized variable if the catch block has initialized the variable when an Exception is raised in try block in Java  for example  If the lambda is lazily  why does Kotlin can t use an uninitialized variable in lambda  I know Kotlin is a null safety language  so the compiler will analyzing the code from top to bottom include the lambda body to make sure the variable is initialized  so the lambda body is not  lazily  at compile time  for example  Q  But why the code below also can t be working  I don t understand it  since the variable is effectively final in Java  if you want to change the variable value you must using an instead  and this test contradicts my previous conclusions  lambda body is not lazily at compile time   for example  So I only can think is that the compiler can t sure the field in is whether initialized or not  but  hotkey has denied my thoughts  Why  Q  why does Kotlin inline functions can t works fine even if I initializing the variable in catch block like as in java  for example  But   hotkey has already mentioned that you should using expression in Kotlin to initializing a variable in his answer  for example  Q  If the actual thing is that  why I don t call the directly  for example  However the code above can works fine in java  for example

Do I need to update Kotlin every time I work on my company s application  I m having trouble building an Android project at the company I am working for  Currently  I get a whole bunch of errors when I try to build my project due to the specified versions of the dependencies defined in the  gradle file not matching the current version of kotlin  So  to rectify this I have updated the highlighted dependency versions in the project to match the current version of kotlin I am using  My big question is whether I have to do this every time I want to develop on Android  I m assuming the answers a big fat NO  but as someone completely new to this  I definitely need some help from the community if possible  Just to explain me  we have limited development resources  hence the question on here  I m going to be taking over the Android side of things and should probably sign up for a one week taster course  or something like that  but for now  I have our whole Android app on our hands with minimal comments  tests or instructions  I also posted this question to Reddit and the best advice I was given was to add a  +  to the dependencies in build gradle instead of version numbers  I ve since tried this and feel like it might not be the solution I need  This is because I feel that the live application wouldn t be working if this were the issue  In short  I feel like my local version of the application might not be working because I have some settings in Kotlin Android studio somewhere that I need to change     Any suggestions you can provide RE what these settings may be would be a huge help

How to enforce an empty  non null String in Kotlin  I often want to hold a string that can not be null or blank   whitespace isn t good enough  The compiler handles nicely to prevent null  and we can use to check if it is null or blank  However  this requires that the blank check be handled everywhere it is used then handle errors if it is blank  which can cause unexpected errors if you miss a spot  Is there an easier way to define a type or extension to that will enforce that the string must not be blank 
Compiler warning while using  Value annotation in Kotlin project Is there any type in Kotlin language that I could use in a late initialization instead of so that I do not get a compiler warning  Let s say I have a class like this one  I can t use type from Kotlin because it s primitive type and does not accept it  If I stick to it works just fine but I am getting compiler warning of this sort  Obviously I might create needed type myself but I simply wonder if there is something out of the box and recommended that we should use in such situation and I simply can t find it   Annotated constructor is not a solution in this particular case

AspectJ Compiler problems with kotlin delegation in type hierarchy NOTICE TLDR  I discovered that this was simply an environmental problem  The JAR with the kotlin code had old class files that caused unexpected problems that the compiler was 100  handling correctly  I think that there was another class file in the JAR that I was trying to depend upon that was called that was a class instead of an interface  The Gradle Kotlin compile plugin didn t remove these classes when I removed the files  LPT  Run the Gradle clean task before trying to publish  even if you are only publishing to maven local  I m having a problem with aspectj linking against code that uses kotlin classes from another project  The aspectJ compiler is running version   My particular problem is that  I keep seeing this  I have a type hierarchy where where is written in kotlin and compiled in another project and is java compiled with the aspectj compiler  looks like this  I have no idea why the aspectj compiler can t figure out the type hierarchy  It should be looking at the bytecode for and saying that obviously is an instance of a   As an example  the following code  trying to be compiled by the aspectJ compiler   Compiling the above class gives this error from maven  IntelliJ seems completely fine with this code  I think that it using the JavaC compiler for linting however  My questions are  why is this happening  Is there a known problem in the AspectJ compiler  Are there similar problems with interop with groovy and the aspectJ compiler for example  Update I ve tried adding the following to see if it solves the problem  Now I have all the same exceptions as before but with a new exception added to the mix

Type interference issue with the WebFlux WebTestClient and Kotlin I m building a prototype for a new application using Spring Webflux and Kotlin  Spring Webflux contains a WebTestClient for unit tests  According to the documentation I should be able to test the results of a REST call like this  However  I m running into some type interference issues  The problem is in the combination of  expectBody  and  isEqualTo   The error I get is  The used methods have the following signatures  Sadly I m running into the limits of my knowledge of generics and the differences between Kotlin and Java which means that I m not sure how I should specify this  Edit  Like I said below  it compiles when I use   However  this causes a NullPointerException when the isEqualTo ends without a failure  This seems to be because the  isEqualTo  method returns a value  which is now defined as the  Nothing  type

Kotlin  appendText and closing resources I m new to Kotlin  but I have a strong Java background  Java is my day job   I m loving some of the shortcut functions in Kotlin  One of the big ones is File appendText    It s very convenient  IMO  My question is about closing resources  If I was to use a writer  I would do something like this  But I don t see any thing directly on the appendText method that indicates closing resources  Does Kotlin handle this behind the scenes for me  or is this something I have to worry about in another way  Thanks

Updating collection based Widget RemoteViews after AsyncTask callback I m in a situation where the elements of my Widget s ListView are reliant on content fetched over the network via an AsyncTask  The code for getViewAt in my RemoteViewsFactory implementation is as follows  And the AsyncTask is defined as an inner class My basic train of thought is that I should perform the rendering of some default layout to the RemoteViews and return that to be inserted into the list  then allow the network operations to take place in the background  I then make modifications in the onPostExecute method of the AsyncTask on the same instance of RemoteViews  which I believe should in theory result in the actual list element being updated  However  despite the onPostExecute being run and the view being populated with its initial layout  the image is never set  Does anybody have any thoughts on how to achieve this  Afterthought  I ve tried just using a TextView and setting some static text in the AsyncTask and that also does not work

Suppress  Use property access syntax  for method or class In my project  I have a delegate written in Java  for fetching data by RPC  most of it methods start with  get  and some require no parameters  so Kotlin suggests to replace calls to them with property access syntax while they are not fulfilling property semantics  well  because they perform network requests   so I d like to suppress all such inspections for all these methods usages by default and not in place of every call  yes  I m aware of annotation for blocks  and it works exactly opposite to what I need   Is there any solution for this except renaming them so they won t start with  get

Assert Variable is not Null I have a Variable with type In a Function I check it for being and want to use it afterwards without always having to every call  In e g  Kotlin the IDE recognizes a check like that and asserts that the variable cannot be afterwards  Is there a way to do this in C   Edit  When using instead it works in this case because doesn t have nullsafety at all  However  considering that this would compile even without the null check and just produce an error  the general question still remains  How can one persuade C  that a former nullable variable isn t nullable any more  Edit 2 Casting DateTime on the Variable works  Still not as safe as in Kotlin  but similar enough

Firebase SDK in Kotlin   onChildChanged not firing on first child in list I m developing a server side app using Kotlin for managing my list of web customers in Firebase  I ve successfully added the Java Firebase Admin SDK to my Kotlin and have gotten a functional connection with my Realtime Database  However  I just noticed one problem  I added a ChildEventListener for listening to changes to their data  and it works nice on every customer but the first one in the list  No matter if I order the data or no with  orderBy   the first queried item never receives a ChildChanged callback when actually edited in the database  I thought there could be some problem with the data in my customers  so it crashed without even throwing an exception  but even after adding a single println for checking a ChildChanged callback was fired  it doesn t do a thing with the first customer in the list  I ve done a similar code in the past for Java  without Kotlin  and they always worked great  I m using latest Firebase Java SDK version  5 2 0  Has anyone experienced a similar error

Android onCheckedChangeListener bizzare behavior So I am attempting to code some CheckBox logic for a page in which a user can +1 or  1 a specific entry  The first time my RecyclerViewAdapter is bound  I iterate through the list of votes and check if the user id is present  and if the vote value is +1 or  1 here Which works fine  If I previously voted +1 and reload  boom  the box is checked  The issue  however  comes when I then try to interact with the boxes again  If I hit the +1 box  the check remains and doesnt do anything  This also occurs for the  1 box  I also set my listeners for the CheckBoxes in the bindtask function like so It should also be worth mentioning that I have a socket listener in my fragment class that uses the adapter listening for a +1 and  1 event  in which case it updates the score of the item and notifys the adapter that the data set has changed  like here private val onUpvote = Emitter Listener   args  >    val data = args 0  as JSONObject    var newScore  Int    var updatedId  Int    System out println data     if activity  = null           activity runOnUiThread              try                  newScore = data getInt  score                  updatedId = data getInt  id                  for  i in LUNCHVOTE DESTINATIONS size   1 downTo 0                       val destination = LUNCHVOTE DESTINATIONS get i                     if updatedId == destination id                           LUNCHVOTE DESTINATIONS get i  score = newScore

Spring Boot  mustache file extension I m working on a spring boot application and adding a small configuration web page using Mustache templates using this article as an example  I have it working fine when all of my mustache template files have the extension  html  but the problem is that I don t get any IDE support  IntelliJ IDEA has a plugin for mustache  but the extension has to be  mustache  When I change the file extensions  though  I end up with a 404 error  I ve seen in the official example that they are using  mustache  so I know it s possible  I couldn t find anything in that project to indicate that a setting was changed to enable this  The only major difference is that I am using Kotlin instead of Java  but I don t see why that would have any effect on the mustache file extensions  What am I missing  Thanks

What s the recommended way to deal with Singletons cleanup in Android  Kotlin   I have been having some weird issues in my Android app when closing it via back key and reentering  and found they are happening because variables in 2 Singleton classes I have are never re initializing  The issue doesn t happen if manually killing the app from task manager   Even after I call finish explicitly on Main activity onBackPressed and I can see onDestroy is called  the Singletons are still in memory  I decided to do manual cleanup of these Singletons before destroying my Activity  the problem is using Kotlin I would need to make all their member variables nullable     and it would be a lot of hassle to remember to assign null to every variable  so for now I opted to handle the instantiation of the Singleton like this and just make null the whole instance while cleaning  Client use  These seems more involved than it should  and I know this is not even thread safe  but keep in mind that simply using the  object  keyword instead of  class  will not work  as it will prevent any initialization taking place the second time I run the app  the constructor is not being called again and I can t force destroy the instance   This makes me think it might be worth looking into Android dependency injection but I feel like at least one of my Singletons really needs to be accessed on a lot of places so it might not be an elegant solution either  Probably need to refactor it into smaller functionalities   The main issue here is the way android handles destruction but I guess I can t change that  I don t see any reason why it keeps all the static values of non activity classes if the application activities are already destroyed  The question is how do you deal with this cases regardless of the language used  or what do you think are the best practices in this case  Edit  Actually I just did a test with Dagger 2  and the same problem happens  if I use  Provides and  Singleton  the values of member variables on the provided object the second time launching the app are not null so I guess this needs to be dealt with explicitly unless I am missing some more annotations to tell Dagger that the instance should be released at the end of the app life cycle

Intellij not including gradle dependency on classpath when running an app IntelliJ is not including by logback classic dependency on classpath when running the application from IDE  it is kotlin application  but it shouldn t matter   My gradle build contains a line  Dependency is correctly listed under  External Libraries  in IntelliJ  When I try to manually reference a class that the dependency provides in the source code  compiler doesn t complain and it compiles the code successfully  However  when I run the application I get ClassNotFoundException  I included the code to list out the runtime classpath  And the output  when run from IDE  doesn t include logback classic  Sample output  Fascinatingly  logback core is in there while logback classic is not  and logback core is a transitive dependency of logback classic   I tried invalidating InteliJ cahces  rebuilding and restarting InteliJ  Compling from gradle and running the jar works fine  Any suggestions

Kotlin val difference getter override vs assignment I started playing arround with Kotlin and read something about mutable val with custom getter  As refered in e g here or in the Kotlin Coding Convention one should not override the getter if the result can change  But just from the perspective of usage as in the guidelines where is the difference between the following two From this answer I could see that for getter override the value is not stored  Is there something else where the getter override is different form the assignment  Maybe with delegates or latinit 
Kotlin  targeting Java interop  Idiomatic type for lazy collection  When targeting Java interop  what type should one use for a lazy collection  makes the most sense for Kotlin callers due to extension functions on it being lazy by default  but forces Java callers to deal with a Kotlin stdlib type and convert the sequence iterator manually  sequence does not extend iterable   makes sense for Java callers due to implicit usage in for loops  but will cause unsuspecting Kotlin callers to accidentally drop laziness due to non lazy extension functions is optimal for both Java and Kotlin callers but may have overhead and is Java 8+  Kotlin targets 6+

Using EventBus to finish an Activity from Base Activity  Working on an existing project  I found this rather uncommon piece of implementation  to me at least   Since I am not in contact with the previous developer who already left  and before I dismiss this as a case of simply copy and pasting code from another part of our codebase  I would like to ask the SO community about this  Here s your everyday activity that extends BaseActivity  and the implementation  In BaseActivity kt  there s a subscription to the event which calls finish    Now  why would anyone use EventBus to call from the extended BaseActivity  instead of just calling it then and there  in the above SignActivity   Even if SomeActivity were actually a fragment  you could simply call    With regards to the intent flags  you could also use to finish all activities in the back stack if your min SDK is 16  Thanks in advance for feeding my curiosity   D

Multi threaded image rendering in JavaFx Kotlin I m trying to fill an image  in JavaFx  as fast as possible using all CPU cores  but I m running into some issues  Below is the smallest possible example that I could come up with that reproduces the problem  When I call on the s created with the function  the image renders correctly  but apparently only a single CPU core is used  Why is that  On the other hand  when I don t call on the returned jobs  all CPU cores are utilized but  obviously  the image rendering is not correct  because the parent method doesn t wait for the jobs to finish  Any way I can make it fill on all cores and still look right 
Implementing search that pushes results to list as soon as they become available using rxJava I need to implement a search on a large data set that can take some time to complete on mobile devices  So I want to display each matching result as soon as it becomes available  I need to fetch all available data from a data store that decides whether to get them from network or from the device  This call is an   As soon as the data from that Observable becomes available I want to loop over it  apply a search predicate and notify any Observers for any match found  So far my idea was to use a to subscribe to and call its function every time the search finds a new match  However I can t seem to get the desired behavior to work  I m using MVVM + Android Databinding and want to display every matched entry in a so for every event that is received by the observing viewModel I have to call on the RecyclerView s adapter    The problem I have with the above code is that with an empty query is called 3 times in a row and when the query is not empty isn t called at all  I suspect the problem lies somewhere in the way I have nested the Observables in or that I m subscribing wrong   getting data from a wrong thread  Does anyone have an idea about this

Is it possible to avoid code repetition when an object should return a modified copy of itself  I m currently writing some classes that represent symbolic mathematical expressions  All of these are immutable  However  I found myself often repeating the same kind of structure  so I created an interface to avoid repetition  but find myself unable to avoid duplicating the  substituteInside  method  see below   which returns a copy of the object with components corresponding to  find  replaced with  replace   This behavior is the same for all instances of this interface  In my current solution  the interface requires implementing a method which returns the modified copy of the object  The interface can then be implemented as follows  these classes represent the operation of getting some component of an expression  This improves things as other methods returning a copy of the object can use that method and thus can live in the interface  but I still have to copy this method everywhere  while it basically always does the same thing

What is an equivalent of private static final field in Kotlin  Actually the question is  which approach is better and which convention do you use  E g  in order to improve readability we ve added this field in Java class  Now the better approach is to use companion object  or and outside the class  or maybe do you use different approaches  And the additional question is  if we use the second convention  should we use camel case or uppercase with underscore   I m talking manly about Android code  
Best practices for Data mapper on Android  Kotlin and Java  I m struggling trying to find the best way to structure the mapping of my WS classes that represents JSON objects that I get from the rest client to Realm objects to save it on local database  and vice versa when I need to send a post to server  It is a structuring problem actually  I don t know if I should create a GlobalMapper that maps all those models  it s 26 models as of yet   Or if I should create a package mapper and create a mapper for each model  Or using extension functions inside Kotlin model classes and WS classes inside companion objects and static functions on those model and ws java classes  So I would like suggestions on how you guys would achieve that

Firebase requests never complete on Android I am currently building a native android app in Kotlin with Android Studio 3  Canary   I am also utilizing Firebase Realtime Database and Firebase Auth  Here are my gradle dependecies  Everything worked fine until communication with my Firebase Database stopped completing  I don t get any errors but all Listeners I have registerd are not being triggerd anymore  For example  The statement is never reached  This is some Logger output  which I belive is related  It looks to me like all WebSocket connection attempts time out and are therefore retried  This output repeats over and over again  But if I m right  what is causing this problem  I haven t found any similar issues googling  I ran the code both on a physical device and in the emulator  I have a web client connected to the same database  which is still working though  so I guess it s not a server side problem  The worst thing ist  I reset my project to a point were it used to work but that did not help  I know this is not much information but I don t know how to further analyse the problem

How to avoid partial coverage with lateinit fields in Kotlin I have an Android service written in Kotlin which I inject using Guice  It has lateinit fields which cannot be null  but they must be lateinit because I cannot use constructor injection  Something around these lines  Now when I create JaCoCo reports  all lines where any of the lateinit fields are accessed are marked as partially covered  I think Kotlin compiler adds some checks to the bytecode to make sure that fields are initialized before they are accessed  Is there any way to disable these checks  I want my 100  coverage   
Can I update a deeply nested immutable object without making it aware of its context  Let s imagine I have a nested immutable object graph  along these lines  using Kotlin syntax  but hopefully it s clear   Now  I want to switch the kettle on  If the objects were mutable I would just write  But because they are immutable I have to write   Actually  it s slightly more complicated  but this pseudo code will do   I don t like this  not because it s long  per se  but because the Kettle now needs to know not just about its own internal state  but about the full context it exists in  How can I rewrite this so that each object can be responsible for providing its own mutation logic  without having to be aware of the full object graph  Or am I just trying to marry object oriented and functional concepts in an impossible way

Extremely slow in autocompletion   code analysis for Kotlin projects in Intellij IDEA We have a project on IDEA that consists of a couple med sized Java packages and one very small Kotlin package  5 files   I noticed performance is fine with any Java packages  but it s 10x slower in autocompletion  code analysis and compilation for the very small Kotlin package  Autocompletion occasionally was so slow to a point where the popover couldn t load all the methods and it had to load a couple API incrementally  Every time our developer types a word and wait for autocomplete  it takes about 2 5 seconds for the expected autocomplete to show up  Sometimes autocomplete was too slow to show anything  and we had to cancel the word and retyped it and waited  Same slowness occurs in code analysis  This is significantly impacting my team s productivity  From our research  it appears this is a well known long lasting issue  This also happens for our another small project  I was wondering what we can do to fix this  Thanks  Kotlin plugin is latest  Version  1 1 3 release IJ2017 2 2 Intellij is also on latest version  2017 2 1  built on July 31 2017

Pass Nullable Parameter to Function only when non null  otherwise use default parameter Imagine the piece of code The way I want it to work is that is overridden by the default value of the parameter  i e  if is then it would print else it would print Of course  this could be achieved by making the parameter nullable and using the elvis operator in the function body  but that makes it less obvious what is happening  and means that the default value of the parameter wouldn t be visible in the IDE when calling the function  Is there an idiomatic way to do this

Kotlin JPA Encapsulate OneToMany I am using JPA with Kotlin and coming against an issue trying to encapsulate a OneToMany relationship  This is something I can easily achieve in Java but having some issues due to Kotlin only having properties and no fields in classes  I have an order  and an order has one to many line items  The order object has a MutableList of LineItem BUT the get method SHOULD NOT return a mutable list  or anything that the caller could potentially modify  as this breaks encapsulation  The order class should be responsible for managing collection of line items and ensuring all business rules   validations are met  This is the code I ve come up with thus far  Basically I m using a backing property which is the MutableList which Order class will mutate  and then there is a transient property which returns Iterable  and ensure that even if caller gets the list  and cast it to MutableList they won t be able to modify it  Is there a better way to enforce encapsulation and integrity  Perhaps I m just being too defensive with my design and approach  Ideally no one should be using the getter to get and modify the list  but hey it happens

Make Kotlin warn on assignment of flexible platform type to non null type  When calling a non nullability annotated Java function from Kotlin  we get flexible typed return values  denoted by exclamation marks  e g    Kotlin silently allows assigning these flexible values to a normal non null type  e g    which can cause NullPointerExceptions at runtime  I would prefer to get compiler warnings or errors for such assignments  Alternatively  treat platform types as equivalent to nullable types  e g     As an example  with this Java code     and the following Kotlin code  I d like to get errors on two new lines  see comments   The point is that this will force me to add null checks or   making sure that I at least have to be explicit about it  Is this possible  In the comments of this 2014 JetBrains blog post  when they introduced platform flexible types  it sounds like they were planning to add an option to warn about exactly these situations  but I haven t been able to find any further information on that

Spring Boot insert invalid datetime into MariaDB results in null  on not nullable field I have a problem in a Spring Boot project  where I have a table created like this  and the entity like this  I also have an endpoint which takes a Task as parameter  where Jackson converts it from JSON to a Task Object  which works fine looking at debug logs  So the problem is that if I give a date which is outside the legal range eg  above the year 9999   hibernate persists it without error  but the field ends up containing null  which shouldn t be possible when it s a not nullable field  I would assume mariadb throws an error if you persist something outside the legal range  which it does when i do it manually  but somehow hibernate manages to do it  and it ends up being null  Trace from hibernate  26543      nio 8080 exec 1  o h p entity AbstractEntityPersister       Dehydrating entity   something model Task <null> 2017 08 15 14 28 22 220 TRACE 26543      nio 8080 exec 1      o h type descriptor sql BasicBinder        binding parameter  1  as  TIMESTAMP     Tue Aug 15 14 28 22 CEST 2017 2017 08 15 14 28 22 221 TRACE 26543      nio 8080 exec 1  o h type descriptor sql BasicBinder        binding parameter  2  as  VARCHAR     NIKlas 2017 08 15 14 28 22 221 TRACE 26543      nio 8080 exec 1  o h type descriptor sql BasicBinder        binding parameter  3  as  TIMESTAMP     null 2017 08 15 14 28 22 222 TRACE 26543      nio 8080 exec 1  o h type descriptor sql BasicBinder        binding parameter  4  as  TIMESTAMP     null 2017 08 15 14 28 22 222 TRACE 26543      nio 8080 exec 1  o h type descriptor sql BasicBinder        binding parameter  5  as  VARCHAR     null 2017 08 15 14 28 22 222 TRACE 26543      nio 8080 exec 1  o h type descriptor sql BasicBinder        binding parameter  6  as  TIMESTAMP     null 2017 08 15 14 28 22 222 TRACE 26543      nio 8080 exec 1  o h type descriptor sql BasicBinder        binding parameter  7  as  BIGINT     null 2017 08 15 14 28 22 222 TRACE 26543      nio 8080 exec 1  o h type descriptor sql BasicBinder        binding parameter  8  as  VARCHAR      2017 08 15 14 28 22 223 TRACE 26543      nio 8080 exec 1  o h type descriptor sql BasicBinder        binding parameter  9  as  TIMESTAMP     Mon Sep 10 05 06 44 CEST 12439173 2017 08 15 14 28 22 224 TRACE 26543      nio 8080 exec 1  o h type descriptor sql BasicBinder        binding parameter  10  as  BOOLEAN     null 2017 08 15 14 28 22 224 TRACE 26543      nio 8080 exec 1  o h type descriptor sql BasicBinder        binding parameter  11  as  VARCHAR      2017 08 15 14 28 22 228 DEBUG 26543      nio 8080 exec 1  o h id IdentifierGeneratorHelper           Natively generated identity  22017 08 15 14 28 22 228 TRACE 26543      nio 8080 exec 1  o h r j i ResourceRegistryStandardImpl     Releasing result set  org mariadb jdbc internal queryresults resultset MariaSelectResultSet$1 1c4fe495 2017 08 15 14 28 22 228 DEBUG 26543      nio 8080 exec 1  o h r j i ResourceRegistryStandardImpl     HHH000387  ResultSet s statement was not registered2017 08 15 14 28 22 228 TRACE 26543      nio 8080 exec 1  o h r j i ResourceRegistryStandardImpl     Closing result set  org mariadb jdbc internal queryresults resultset MariaSelectResultSet$1 1c4fe495 2017 08 15 14 28 22 228 TRACE 26543      nio 8080 exec 1  o h r j i ResourceRegistryStandardImpl     Releasing statement  HikariProxyPreparedStatement 639958422 wrapping sql    insert into task  created at  created by  deleted at  updated at  updated by  closed at  closed by  content  control time  is successful  title  values                                     parameters     2017 08 15 14 28 22 147   NIKlas  <null> <null> <null> <null> <null>     12439173 09 10 05 06 44 928  <null>     2017 08 15 14 28 22 229 TRACE 26543      nio 8080 exec 1  o h r j i ResourceRegistryStandardImpl     Closing prepared statement  HikariProxyPreparedStatement 639958422 wrapping sql    insert into task  created at  created by  deleted at  updated at  updated by  closed at  closed by  content  control time  is successful  title  values                                     parameters     2017 08 15 14 28 22 147   NIKlas  <null> <null> <null> <null> <null>     12439173 09 10 05 06 44 928  <null>     2017 08 15 14 28 2
Listview  smooth scroll to bottom When a button is clicked  I would like the app to smoothly scroll to the bottom of a listview  Currently this is my implementation  kotlin  However  this does not always work properly  Some list items contain some expandable parts  i e  view whose visibility can be VISIBLE or GONE   which initially are hidden  When these parts are expanded however  the function sometimes does not scroll to the end  but to a position before the end  How can I reliably scroll to the end of the listview

Spring Security  Secure endpoint based on client authority I m currently using Spring Security s OAuth2 to implement authorization across a number of micro services  Our performs all of the authentication with OAuth2 tokens etc and can create users  Consider two clients  Client A and Client B  Client A has authorities  Client B has authorities   Yes we could use a scope instead  but this is just an example   Aim  Only Client A  which has the authority   should be allowed to create a user  Users are creating by posting to   Problem  The problem is that when I send a POST request to the  users endpoint with the basic authentication header for Client A  the authority is not found because the request hit the and the only authority found is and I receive the following  One incredibly hacky solution would be to register a custom security filter that reads the basic auth header and verifies that a client s name is equal to Client A  but this will not work for a third client  Client C which also has the authority  as the name and not the authorities are verified here  Client Configuration WebSecurityConfigurerAdaptor impl

Dagger2 + MVP on Kotlin I am studying Dagger2 + MVP and doing it on Kotlin  And I have a problem in understanding either Dagger2 or MVP or there combination  Construction of an application and idea how it should work are very simple  The app consists of with left side navigation and several  let s say 3  that should be changed in the in   I have read several articles and spend already couple of days studying Dagger2  This article I use as tutorial to build my example   In my idea  Dagger architecture should consist of three s    1  AppComponent   2  MenuActivityComponent and  3  AccountFragmentComponent  And from my understanding and the picture of an architecture in the article my architecture can be like this   3  depends on  >  2  depends on  >  1  Each has a    1  AppModule   2  MenuActivityModule and  3  AccountFragmentModule respectively  For the cleaner way of MVP dependencies  as far as I understand  both  2  MenuActivityModule and  3  AccountFragmentModule should s from MVP ideology to be in and other s  such as   AppModule AppComponent MenuActivityModule MenuActivityComponent AccountsFragmentModule AccountsFragmentComponent Also I have two s  ActivityScope and FragmentScope  so as I understand that will guarantee the existence of only one Component for the time every component is need in the application  ActivityScope FragmentScope In Application class I create a graph of dependencies  In MenuActivity  class MenuActivity  AppCompatActivity       Inject lateinit var presenter   MenuActivityPresenter    val Activity app   App    get   = application as App    val component by lazy          app component plus MenuActivityModule this           override fun onCreate savedInstanceState  Bundle            super onCreate savedInstanceState         setContentView

what is the official   right way to make the entity and Dao file when using kotlin trying to use room with kotlin  not find official document  Here is some finding from the fails  made it work for the simple cases but still not sure if it is the right way  so post it here and hope someone knows the office   right way to do it with kotlin  got two issues  first one  when defining the entity it has to be put in the constructor and if not it will compile but not generate the xx impl java  like  but if put in constructor it will generates the xxx impl java  note  for different room versions  someone requires the fields to be initialized  in some version the last one cant have the default value  and in some version all params can be without initialization value  does anyone know what is the right way for it to work for all version    maybe the latest version one   other issue is when the query has params  the compiler seems will put its own name for it in the generated xx impl java file  makes you dont know what to put in the code until after it generates the xx impl java   in different kotlin version it differs  1  in one project grade it has apply plugin   kotlin kapt  and with kotlin version =  1 1 2 4  in there generated xxx impl java has used p0 2  in other project setting with kotlin version =  1 1 3 2   note  if does not have kapt  android arch persistence room compiler 1 0 0 alpha1   it will not generate the xxx impl java file  when in the xxDao file put the query param with   p0  it complains  in there generated xxx impl java it used arg0

Kotlin generate constructor that sets default values to nulled arguments Let s take the class of a data class  When calling this function from Kotlin  it is pretty straightforward  I can simply use the named argument syntax to do so  Calling from Java  I have to specify all values  or use the annotation  which generates the following constructors  in addition to the constructor that kotlin generates with the bit mask for default values   Now  if I want to create a object in Java equivalent to I can t do it with the above constructors  I CAN however do it if I put at the end in the declaration  the generation of constructors seems to depend on the order the optional arguments are defined in   Which is fine  because expecting kotlin to generate all permutations is going to heavily bloat some classes  The biggest problem that tools like simply don t work as they have no idea which constructor to use  and not like I can annotate one of the generated ones specially   So  is there a way to generate a  single  constructor like  Currently I am using the above approach  but manually defining the constructors where I need them  EDIT I should clarify  creating a similar constructor doesn t work  obviously because both the signatures would clash on the JVM  This is what it would like in my case  Also note the redundancy where I have to write the default values for the properties twice  I Now that I look at it  I doubt there exists a solution for this  Maybe this is a good use case for a based side project of mine   
Android   Kotlin   return value in async fun I would like to ask if it s possible to  return  a value from a function if the function doing AsyncTask  For example   The problem in this function is that the AsyncTask is not finish yet so i get a wrong value from the function  any idea how to solve it  is using a interface is the only why or there is a compilation handler like in Swift  
Validating large XML files against large XSDs  is there a quick way to do this  I m trying to quickly validate large XML documents against large XSD s  The XML can be anywhere between 500 to 39000 lines long  and the XSD s are in the region of 2000   3000 lines  The result so far has been horribly slow performance  the initialization of the parser with such large XSDs can take up to 30 seconds  however  this is fine as we can do this once and then just inject it  But  when it comes to actually using this to validate the XML  depending on the implementation it can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes  This is really odd as a command line tool called xmllint  Is able to do the same job but finishes instantly  I ve tried the JDOM library  the SAXReader method and I ve settled on the jdom2 stuff  here s how I m constructing it  And here s the parsing in action  The builder build part is the line that needs to be borderline instant  In terms of the desired solution  I don t mind using C  Kotlin  whatever as long as the output is sensible to read and quick  Thanks

Kotlin constructor delegation to inner data class  We have an abstract Java class  which we can t modify  called that we want to implement in Kotlin  A requirement is the Kotlin implementation is serializable deserializable to JSON using vanilla Jackson Databind  This has lead us to the following implementation  This class will always be used from Java and currently you can instantiate it like this  Java   But we d prefer to instantiate it like this instead  I can of course change the Kotlin code to something like this  but this is very verbose and kind of defeats the purpose of using Kotlin  What I think I d like to do is something like this  pseudo code    note the in the constructor which obviously doesn t work  I e  I d like to somehow destruct or delegate the constructor of MyClass to take the same arguments as MyClassData without duplicating them  Is this something you can do in Kotlin or is there another way to solve it without adding too much code

NullPointerException when trying to access inherited field I`m getting NPE when trying to access overridden variable in parent class I will show simplified code for undestanding problem I have a class for drawing square Square works correctly  but now I want to draw Cube  so I just inherit from Square and add more coordinates Seems logic  right  All variables have values and there should be no place for NPE  But when I try to create instance of Cube I catch NullPointerException in Square class at this line  Even if I assign value directly like I will get NPE at Square class inside init block at this line  So I have 2 questions  1  How can I fix it and still use inheritance  2  Is it really supposed to work that way 
kotlin js extending kotlinx html classes I have tried to learn the Kotlin language this week and wanted to make a simple class that acts as an html element  At first  I saw the org w3c dom library s  HTMLElement  and its chidlren  but extending those is more of a pain than anything I have ever seen in my life  The problem with it is that it is abstract and has about 20 members I have to implement  provide the logic and hope I do it correctly  Then I used the kotlinx html library to create normal divs and other elements  so I thought  I can extend those   A good thing was that it wasnt abstract  so I dont have to do shit and it works right  Well    not that fast  I have to provide 2 parameters for the only constructor it has  As I haven t found any documentation of it as searching anything in the range of  kotlinx html div constructor  to  chuck norris  all result in similar topics to the following  Which is nice  but not what I want  The first parameter is pretty easy to understand from the constructor s declaration as it is named  initialAttributes  so I d assume that would be  class= my class  id= myId   style= display none    etc  providing it an empty HashMap would be sufficient for my case  But then there is the other parameter  consumer  kotlinx html TagConsumer< >  of which I have no idea of what it would do  what it wants and what I should provide  I can t provide  null  as kotlin will complain about it  I can t make an instance of it as it is an interface  and google hasn t helped me out either    again  TL DR  What do I have to place on the question marks in the following code  Or  what should I use instead of kotlinx html DIV to extend to make custom html elements

Kotlin s crossinline keyword I have read this question but I have a more fundamental question regarding the keyword  I m not really sure what problem it is solving and how it solves it  From the Kotlin Docs   Emphasis added  This statement is ambiguous to me  First  I am having trouble actually picturing what is meant by  such cases   I have a general idea of what the issue is but can t come up with a good example of it  Second  the phrase  To indicate that   can be read multiple ways  To indicate what  That a particular case is not allowed  That it is allowed  That non local control flow in a given function definition is  or is not  allowed  In short  I have trouble figuring out what the context for using this really is  what using it communicates to clients  and what the expected results of applying this keyword are

Java 2 minute delay sometimes when connecting socket  I m baffled with the following mystery  When testing my application  I frequently  maybe 25  of the time  get a two minute delay when connecting an SSL socket  I m using Java 8  Ubuntu 16 04  When I use wireshark I can see that nothing is sent over the network to the target server  Maybe there could be other network traffic like DNS resolving  The delay is always 2 minutes with an uncertainty of no more than a couple seconds  The last log message before it hangs is  Pausing in a debugger verifies that it s blocked in socket connect code in class PlainSocketImpl  I m pretty sure I d have noticed if this hang happens to other applications  I think it just affects my Java program  My  Kotlin  code is as follows  The last clue I have to offer is that the time spent paused in the debugger doesn t count towards the two minutes  I can wait five minutes with it paused  unpause it and it will still take exactly two minutes  That tells me it s not waiting for an external process to complete because the external process would make progress during the paused time 
Match brackets the kotlin way I m giving Kotlin a go  coding contently  I have an ArrayList of chars which i want to classify depending on how brackets are matched  My solution comes out recursive   This works  but is this how you do it in Kotlin  It feels like I ve coded java in Kotlin syntax Found this Functional languages better at recursion  I ve tried thinking in terms of manipulating functions and sending them down the recursion but to no avail  I d be glad to be pointed in the right direction  code  or some pseudo code of a possible refactoring   Omitted some extension methods regarding brackets  I think it s clear what they do 
Break out of an anonymous function in kotlin Created a test case to try and represent what I m trying to do  I can t figure out how to  stop  continuing to do work inside of an anonymous function  In the example below I would like to break out of the  apple  section if the answer is correct  The code below doesn t compile because it says return apple instead of return banana which is the only valid option but I wrote it below to try and explain what I m trying to achieve and better understand how to go about doing something like this

Kotlin   How to make field read only for external classes I have the following Kotlin class on Android  Now  any external class can get the INetwork reference by simply doing  However  that also makes it possible for an external class to overwrite that value  I want to avoid the second option  Unfortunately  I can t make the field because its initialization needs to happen inside the callback  I also thought about making the field private and exposing it through a function  like this  However  whoever calls getNetwork   can still assign a new value to it  like so  How can I make the network field to be read only by external classes  Or even better  is there a way to make it even though I can t initialize it inside a constructor

What is the purpose of having bound class reference return a covariant type  I m playing with reflection and I came out with this problem  When using bound class reference via the syntax  I get a covariant KClass type  As I could learn from the docs  this will return the exact type of the object  in case it is instance of a subtype of   hence the variance modifier  However this prevents retrieving properties declared in the class and getting their value  which is what I m trying to do  I found that a solution is using extension function on the object reference  to get instead the invariant type  This way  I get both the exact type at runtime and the possibility to consume the type  Interestingly  if I use a supertype instead of a generic  with the latter method I still get access to the correct type  without the need of variance  If I got it correct  is equal to calling the java   which returns a variant type with a wildcard  while is a with a cast to the specific type  Still  I don t get why would I ever need a covariant KClass  when it limits me to only produce the type  given that there are other ways to access the exact class at runtime and use it freely  and I wonder if the more immediate should return an invariant type by design

kotlin setter infinte recursion I am testing out kotlin on Android and ran into a problem where the setters of two variables get called in an infinte recursion because they try to change each other when they are originally set  Here is a sample code And say I then use the following code  It ends up causing an infinte recursions and eventually a stackoverflow  The setter for calls the setter for which in turn calls the setter for again  And it goes on for ever  I want to be able to update the value for whenever is set  but also update the value of whenever is set  Any thoughts from the Kotlin experts out there  Would I need to make Java like setters in this case so that my setter code doesn t get called whenever I assign a value to or   Or is there some nifty Kotlin goodness that I can use

Odd TestObserver behaviour when subscribing to a Subject Consider the following RxJava 2 snippet in Kotlin  From my understanding  should be able to receive after waiting on statement 5 and the assertion on statement 6 should succeed  However  what actually happens is  5 blocks until it times out because no value is received and the assertion on 6 fails  Also  if I put a breakpoint on 3 and just resume the execution after it pauses  everything will work  Looks like a threading problem  I m clearly missing something here  What would be the correct way to consume a hot observable

Store data in BEAN  Spring Boot REST  I am creating a REST API with Spring Boot  Most of the data come from a database but some data is fetched from third party APIs  The problem is some of them have access limitations like max 10 requests per minute or something  Now I am looking for a method to cache the data in my spring application and only update it every few seconds  Storing it in the db and updating it every 10 seconds is a little bit too much since the fetched data is about 1000 rows  So I thought I simply store it in my service bean  This is my approach so far   Coded in Kotlin  It works but it seems kinda hacky to me  Not really a clean solution  is it  If someone has a better approach to this I would be very thankful

Return value of if else condition  but also run code I m a newbie to Kotlin  but I freaking love it  There s a wonderful feeling when you can turn three lines of code into one  Now I often find myself looking at my code and thinking  there s some redundancy here  There should be a more concise way to do it   And when I do some searching  often Kotlin does provide a more succinct way  Here s a problem where I FEEL there should be a simple  concise Kotlin solution  but am not aware of it  Hopefully you can enlighten me  Take code like this contrived example  Based on an condition  I want to run some code and then return the value of the condition  It just bothers me that I have to explicitly say  if the condition is true  return   If it is false  return    It seems redundant  Of course  I could say   but I want to run code based on if it is true  Is there a magic operator Kotlin has that I don t know about  Should I make a function to handle this situation for me  although the syntax of calling that would be different than an if statement  Is there some kind of mapping function  or some way to overload if  It seems like there should be a concise  clever answer  but it s not coming to me

kotlin  java  nativescript or xamarin for android development I am planning to develop an enterprise level application for android which may or may not be made for ios and windows later  Currently I am a UWP developer and I have lot of experience with c  and xaml hence I opted to learn xamarin in order to build my new application  I have zero knowledge or experience in android uptil now  XAMARIN   I thought to learn it but after some searching on internet I found out it will not give as good experience and efficiency as a app created with java because my app will have native APIs required like google maps and live location on maps within the app etc  So I decided to leave it for now and move towards java  JAVA   I already have a little bit knowledge of java so its not totally new to me but honestly I hate using it and I prefer c  a lot so after some research I found out about this new language   i e  kotlin Kotlin  I see tht kotlin solves a lot of common problems of java language  But does it have big enough community for a new developer in android like myself  NativeScript  I also have some experience with web technologies and I know about nativescript which can be used to create native cross platform mobile applications and it is supposed to be native totally and not run within a webview    Suggestion      The reason I am confused with which language to start my android development career is hopefully clear to you as of now  So I need some honest suggestions about which technology to prefer  considering my specific needs  the basic needs for my app are following  social media network type app  will require google maps deeply integrated like in uber will require connection with a backend server ofcourse for database and other web services  I want and prefer to use the brilliant material design for UI of my app  My app will use wifi and   dataConnection  4g  3g      as well  I want my app to be efficient and fast considering the factors above  It will probably and most likely be on uwp platform and also ios platform as well in future  I plan to use Microsoft Azure for any kind of server related web services  I like to use open source 3rd party libraries for both UI and code behind for my apps

Clean Architecture  Use different model classes for different data sources  I am currently developing a news feed android app  I try to design my app according to the principles of clean architecture  In the data layer I am using the repository pattern as a facade for the diferent data sources  remote data from an API     local data from an DB  Realm or SQLite  as well as some in memory cache  In my domain layer I have defined some immutable model classes  Article  NewsSource  etc   which are being used by the domain layer as well as the presentation layer  no need for extra model classes in the presentation layer in my opinion   Does it make sense to use different model classes for the remote data source as well as for the local data source  E g  The remote data source uses Retrofit to make API calls and the models need to be annotated in order to be parsed by GSON  The models for the local data source also may have to fulfill some certain contract like models in a Realm DB need to extend RealmObject  Obviously  I don´t want my domain models to be  polluted  by any data source specific contract  annotations  RealmObject inheritance  etc    So I thought it would make sense to use different models for different data sources and the repository handles the mapping between them  E g  We want to fetch all articles from the remote API  store them in the local DB and return them to the domain layer  Flow would be like  Remote data source makes http request to news api and retrieves a list of ´s  The repository would map these models to a Domain specific article model     Then these would be mapped to DB models  e g    and inserted into the DB  Finally the list of ´s would be returned to the caller  Two questions arise  The above example shows how many allocations there would be using this approach  For every article that is going to be downloaded and inserted into the DB  three models would be created in that process  Would that be overkill  Also  I know that the data layer should use different model classes than the domain layer  inner layer should no nothing about outer layer   But how would that make sense in the above example  I would already have two different model classes for the two different data sources  Adding a third one that´s being used as a  mediator  model by the data layer repository to handle mapping to other models  remote  local  domain  would add even more allocations  So should the data layer know nothing about domain models and let the domain do the mapping from a data layer model to a domain layer model  Should there be a generic model used only by the repository data layer  Thank  I really appreciate any help from more experienced developers

How to implement Memento Pattern in Kotlin I am currently trying to implement some design patterns in Kotlin as an exercise and I m a bit stuck with the  Memento  pattern  My reference resource is SourceMaking  Memento  I want to implement this structure  While following their  Checklist  Identify the roles of  caretaker  and  originator   Create a Memento class and declare the originator a friend  Caretaker knows when to  check point  the originator  Originator creates a Memento and copies its state to that Memento  Caretaker holds on to  but cannot peek into  the Memento  Caretaker knows when to  roll back  the originator  Originator reinstates itself using the saved state in the Memento  I can t get step 5 to work  How do I make a object whose fields can be read from inside the instance but that is completely opaque to the   I have successfully implemented this in Java as follows  And a Caretaker Because they are inner classes I can read the private fields of and from my instance  but to the my instance is completely opaque  only showing s member functions   Now how do I implement this exact behavior in Kotlin  Basically I am missing the functionality of reading private fields of inner classes  The closest thing I could think of was this  This has the desired effect of being completely opaque to my instance  but I can t read the fields from within either  This code by the way is almost exactly the same as the generated code produced by the  Convert Java to Kotlin  feature of IntelliJ applied to my Java code  and it obviously doesn t compile either   So is there something obvious  or magical  I am missing here  Maybe something other than the structure displayed in the class diagram

 Property type is not a subtype of overridden abstract val  on multiple inherited field Sometimes  a type is declared to implement 2 interfaces which both have an abstract property the same name  but when I moved the bounded type argument to a top level abstract superclass and subclass it in different objects  the class overriding the the abstract property on both superinterfaces fails to compile when using type arguments for a subclass  The generated interfaces and abstract class  An example of the generated object which overrides 2 superinterface properties with the same name  And then the interfaces for the API  In order to have polymorphism for different fields on types implementing an interface yet requiring different arguments so I can declare them like this   There s a separate set of interfaces for for a field like in the example but I left that out for brevity  What am I doing incorrectly  Or is this not possible

Kotlin and idiomatic way to write   if not null  else     based around mutable value Suppose we have this code  Unlike in Java  where you could be left alone to worry about null dereferencing at runtime  this doesn t compile   quite rightly  Of course  may no longer be null once within the  if   My question is what s the best way to handle this  A few options are apparent  Without using any new Kotlin language features  the simplest way is obviously to copy the value to a method scope one that won t subsequently change  There s this  This has the obvious disadvantage that you need to return early or otherwise avoid executing the subsequent code   OK in certain  small contexts  but has a smell to it  Then there s this possibility  but whilst it has greater clarity of purpose  arguably it s more unwieldy and verbose than the Java style way of dealing with this  Am I missing anything  and is there a preferred idiom with which to achieve this

Using phone to simulate butterfly net  determining positioning of the net In Kotlin I am working on a program where the user moves their phone to control a virtual butterfly net  The positional information is sent to an and the UI application will get the data  My problem is accurately showing the position  If the phone is the net part of the catcher  then ideally as you move the phone  using the accelerometer I should know which direction you are moving  and can send that data  Nice in theory  harder in practice  This is my code  but the last four points isn t giving me enough information for my approach  I would like to basically determine the direction in 3 dimensions and the acceleration  so I am creating a vector  Then when the direction changes  and the force  I could go with a new vector  But  I am not accurately getting the information  and then I should just send it as  x y z  in one packet  and the UI could then take that and translate the net to the new location  I am trying to adjust based on the orientation of the phone  in the beginning section  How do I accurately track the positional information
