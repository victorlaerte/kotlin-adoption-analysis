I tried to remove the finish () method, those who are in the code to not eliminate the first activity, the bad thing is that if I do that, the first blank activity will appear and the login buttons offered by firebaseUI will not be drawn.

So far I've succeeded in getting the picker to display in a dialog fragment and getting it to display the custom strings I want it to. I've also disabled the descendantFocusability so the text is not editable. Here is an overview of the questions I have about NumberPicker behaviour, I'll go more in depth after: How does one 'commit' their selection? How to return the selected value? How does one 'commit' their selection? When the dialog appears, I don't see a clear way to 'select' an option (see image below). Looking at native Android selection dialogs, I often see radiobuttons. Is that the way to go? And am I using the wrong UI component to build this? How to return the selected value? This question is tightly knit with the last one, as not knowing how to commit a selection obviously doesn't help here. Right now I use to see if the value changed, however it never fires. Here's how I structured the code: And this is the code I use when I create an instance: However, this block never gets called. TL;DR: Am I using the right UI component? If I am, how would I implement this in a way that it works? Why does the NumberPicker not have a section by default (see image of DatePicker below)? Thanks in advance! "
