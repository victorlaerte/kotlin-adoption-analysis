132	q132	0.49459418520073617 "Fragment instance is retained but child fragment is not re-attached"," Update: accepted answer points to explanation (bug) with a work-around, but also see my Kotlin based work-around attached as an answer below. This code is in Kotlin, but I think it is a basic android fragment life-cycle issue. I have a Fragment that holds a reference to an other \"subfragment\" Here is basically what I am doing: I have a main fragment that has set to true I have a field in the main fragment that will hold a reference to the subfragment, initially this field is null In the main fragment's , I check to see if the subfragment field is null, if so, I create an instance of the subFragment and assign it to the field Finally I add the subfragment to a container in the layout of the main fragment. If the field is not null, ie we are in onCreateView due to a configuration change, I don't re-create the subfragment, I just try to added it to the containter. When the device is rotated, I do observe the and methods of the subfragment being called, but I don't see any lifecyle methods being called on the subfragment during the process of adding the retained reference to the subfragment, to the child_container when the main fragments view is re-created. The net affect is that I don't see the subfragment view in the main fragment. If I comment out the if (subfragment == null) and just create a new subfragment everytime, i do see the subfragment in the view. Update The answer below does point out a bug, in which the childFragmentManager is not retained on configuration changes. This will ultimately break my intended usage, which was to preserve the backstack after rotation, however I think what I am seeing is something different. I added code to the activities method and I see something like this when the app is first launched: and then after rotation: here fm is the childFragmentManager, and as you can see, we still have the same instance of Tab1Fragment, but it has a new childFragmentManager, which I think is unwanted and due to the bug reported in the answer below. The thing is that I did add the subfragment to this new childFragmentManger. So it seems like the transaction never executes with the reference to the fragment that was retained, but does complete if I create a brand new fragment. (I did try calling on the new childFragmentManager) "
