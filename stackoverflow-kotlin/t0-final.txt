All of my calculations are performed by passing in a string such as \"1+3 + (4/2)\" to a class within the library called ExprEvaluator(). A sample usage would be When I run my quiz app and answer a question for the first time, the main UI Thread would freeze as it performed the calculation, but all subsequent calculations would be incredibly fast. Below, I have outlined a bunch of strategies I tried in order to solve the problem. Note: I have injected the ExprEvaluator class with Dagger, and it exists as a singleton Strategy 1: Offload the computation to a seperate thread Result: Didn't make a difference in initial computation time and actually resulted in more issues because I needed the result on the main UI Thread. All subsequent computations were fast as usual. Strategy 2: Run a simple initial computation on my SplashScreen Activity. Result: This is the best possible solution I have found yet but the only drawback is that my splash screen takes too long. Once inside the main app, the quiz performs very well. Strategy 3: Run on a new Thread inside the Splash screen activity Result: This solved the problem of the splash screen taking way too long to load but if I answer a question on the main thread and check it's correctness before other thread's initial computation is complete, the UI thread freezes. I noticed that the first call to evaluate would always be slow, no matter the string I pass in. I could pass in \"1\" and the evaluation would take around 4 seconds while all subsequent more complex evaluations take miliseconds at most. Even if I use a new instance of the ExprEvaluator class for every sincle computation like so: I still get a slow initial computation and all subsquent calls to evaluate are lightning fast. I'm not really sure what's happening here, and I'm wondering if it's a native android issue where heavy computation needs to performed at least once for all subsequent calculations to be smooth. "

The clocks send themselves a stream of messages every tenth of a second, and if running, decrement the time remaining. When the time expires the clock calls a method in the parent view group that stops the clocks and sets a flag that causes further touch events to be ignored so that the users can no longer move the pieces. I am writing in kotlin, but I think this will be clear to a java programmer also: This works fine, but if the user presses the back button and then starts a new game, the clocks apparently keep running, even though the activity's onDestroy method has been called. Then when the running clock expires, the new game is frozen even though the new clocks are still running. I'm new to android and I don't understand how this comes about. I would have thought that the clocks would be destroyed when the activity was. I've tested my ideas about what is happening with log messages, and have confirmed that the clocks run after onDestroy are called. I've also overridden onDetachedFromWindow to stop the clocks, and it makes the problem go away, but this is overkill. It will also stop the clock if the user gets a phone call, won't it, and this is not what I want. Can you suggest how to best accomplish what I want? There is no way to access the clocks from the activity is there?

The activity calls a method in ViewModel which consumes a web-service, and it also observes a LiveData field. Every time the method gets back an an item from the web-service it sets it to the LiveData and so the observer in the Activity is notified and thus all items enter the RecyclerView. It is guaranteed that this flow works correctly as I can see so in the logs, and in the UI too. The problem arises when I put a delay with Thread.slepp(500) in the method where the web-service is consumed. Instead of putting an item in the RecyclerView then wait for 500millis and then put another, it waits 500 millis * numberOfItems and then draws them all together. I can assure that there is no problem with the ViewModel and LiveData setup because the log works as intended meaning, it print the title of the item created, waits 500 millis, prints the next one.

But I'm trying to understand a case where my WeakReference to a function is returning a null reference at random points when the function's owning instance hasn't been garbage collected... Consider the following ViewModel: I pass the results of the original LiveData for further processing to an AsyncTask as well as a function type reference to setValue so the AsyncTask can call the mediator's setValue() in onPostExecute(). Consider the following AsyncTask: I would think so long as onCleared() hasn't been called on the ViewModel, and it hasn't been garbage collected, that the WeakReference will always contain a non-null reference. But it so happens that there are two cases I've seen where mOnFinishCallback.get() returns null. While the app is running, restart the app via Android Studio by pressing Run (Shift + F10). The app will close, restart and my RecyclerView which before had items, is now blank. Via some sysouts, I can see the WeakReference has a null reference. While adding new items to the list via a FAB (processes an insert through a DAO instance) and watching my logs, most of the time the WeakReference is still referencing my the MediatorLiveData's setValue() function but at random times it will be null, but the next time I insert an item and this process repeats it is not null. Any idea why this might be? If my ViewModel, and thus MediatorLiveData are still active and not being garbage collected, shouldn't the MediatorLiveData's setValue() function reference be valid the whole time? "

Being that activity 1 is the main activity and when an specific layout is clicked activity 2, which is a dialog activity is started. The problem I am having is that each time I click the specific layout on activity 1, the onCreate method on activity 2 is invoked (number of times it was invoked before) + 1 times. Meaning that the first time I click the layout are, the onCreate method is called one time. Then I close activity 2 with finish() and if I click the layout area again, the oncreate method of activity 2 is called two times. If I do that again, 3 times, and then 4, 5, etc. Activity one goes like the below, where I add the onClick listener to layout area: Then activity two goes like the below. Note that it has a button which when clicked closes the activity: The names of the activities, layout, etc are fictitious, but the code is inline with my real code. So, the way I figure out onCreate on activity two is being called multiple times, is because I see the log message \"Starting activity two\" multiple times.
