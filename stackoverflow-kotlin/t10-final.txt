The user should be able to interact with the fragments/views the following way: Scrolling the MainList up and down is possible as usual If the user clicks SearchEditView, MainList slides down out of screen while Toolbar slides up out of screen. The SearchEditView slides up to the Toolbar's former position If the user scrolls down the MainList while it is already scrolled to the top, the MainList moves up and down with the finger's movement. The amount the MainList was moved by the finger defines the progress. SearchEditView and Toolbar perform their movements described above, according to the current progress The user can also fling the MainList out of screen (which again applys the made progress to SearchEditView and Toolbar as well) This is basically what it should look like (first part: showing the layout, second part: interaction): What I've tried so far I already tried to use a ViewPager and override transformPage(). This didn't work well. I was not able to position SearchEditView, Toolbar and MainList as desired at the same time. Also, it seemed like a very hacky solution as well. So I tried to handle the touch events on my own. Reacted to the overscrolling of MainList, calculated the velocity to detect whether to hide MainList completely or snap it back to it's default position, created ObjectAnimations for SearchFragment, MainList and Toolbar. That way I could come very close to what I want. But again: it seems not very professional to me, as I had to override the onTouch event of the MainList through it's fragment and the MainActivity (shifted the function two classes up the descendant-tree) Question So, to conclude: How can I achieve my aim the best way possible? Means: In a convenient and robust way, without (seemingly) dirty solutions? I don't really ask for all the code, more for the way you would concept something like that "
