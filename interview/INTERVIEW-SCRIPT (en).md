# Interview Script

- Thank the participant
- Ensure confidentiality
- Ask the interviewees to go as far as possible in the questions presented
- Interviewers should introduce themselves
- Request permission to make recordings

## Context of the Participant

- Can you please tell us your name? (Only if not mentioned before)
- Is that okay if I ask how old are you? (Only if not mentioned before)
- How long have you been working as developer?
- How long have you been working with Android development?
- What is your current role in the organization you work for? (If employed)
- How long have you been working with Kotlin?
- How do you consider your knowledge level in Kotlin?
- Do you have any background with Java ?

## Kotlin (RQ1 and RQ2)

- How was your first contact with Kotlin?
    - If the answer is releated to personal interest go with:
        - What are the reasons that made you adopt Kotlin in Android Development?
    - If the answer is releated to company interest go with:
        - Why did you or your company have chosen start work with Kotlin?
- Do you think Kotlin improves code quality in any way?
- What do you most like in Kotlin development?
- What do you most dislike in Kotlin development?
- Can you remember one or more problems you faced in Kotlin development and had to resort to any specialized forum like StackOverflow?

## Java-Kotlin Interoperability (RQ3)

- Kotlin is designed with Java Interoperability in mind. Existing Java code can be called from Kotlin in a natural way, and Kotlin code can be used from Java as well. In your opinion, what are the benefits of Kotlin and Java interoperability?
- Despite the fact that Kotlin and Java are interoperable, both languages are quite distinct. Have you ever experienced problems trying to interop Kotlin and Java? (64k methods count, companion objects, inheritance, null safety, high order functions)
- What you think could be improved in Kotlin-Java Interoperability?

## High Order Functions/Lambdas (RQ4)

- Do you think that Kotlin provides support for functional programming in any way?
- Have you ever experienced problems with any functional programming practices in Kotlin? Practices like lambdas, high order functions, currying, etc?
- What do you think could be improved in Kotlin functional paradigm support?

## Android Studio / Kotlin Plugin (RQ5)

- In your opinion does Android Studio provide a good experience for Kotlin Developers?
- Have you experienced any problems trying to develop Android Apps with Kotlin regarding Android Studio?
- Gradle is currently the most popular compilation automation system used by android developers. To use Kotlin with Gradle some settings must be made, but may vary depending on the version of gradle and Android Studio you are using. Have you experienced compile issues because of some gradle configuration, including kotlin-android or kapt plugins?
- What do you think could be improved in Android Studio regarding Kotlin?

## Closing

- Thank the participant
- Is there anything else you would like to discuss that was not addressed by the previous questions or you believe that can improve this interview?
- Do you have any questions for me?
