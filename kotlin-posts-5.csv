kotlin best practice parallel nullable null safe trait interface consider following simple trait now assume person class like build library want cater nullable null safe users ll end duplicates like better way achieve trait library function can handle cases without duplicating everything 
nullable operators valid within generic class kotlin pretty features handling nullable types one just stroke don know dealing nullable non nullable type generics class just type kotlin allow nullable operators applied generic type type can made nullable inside class like class will instantiated nullable type like will cause nullable nullable like pointer pointer c++ type within type

kotlin object singleton methods synchronized make sense add annotation object methods make atomic isn needed example want ensure fields updated read objects keep annotation 
preferred syntax using annotation based dependency injection kotlin re using existing framework among things provides dependency injection annotations java inject field value something like since reflection allows reassign fields normally final also valid declaration make declaration even shorter also make fields available unit test classes keeping part semi private api like comes kotlin re stuck nullable type approach requires additional null check operator every service use even though re 100 sure will never null unless something went completely wrong case bigger problems approach seems perform unnecessary checks runtime well highly unlikely become performance bottlenecks still rather verbose approaches allow reassign variable another value re yet find way replacing without overriding getter using back field faces problem ironically longer java declarations many cases preferred way declaring annotated kotlin fields will injected automatically re 100 sure will never null understand multiple frameworks kotlin friendly syntax solving similar problems like injekt asking nicer way
