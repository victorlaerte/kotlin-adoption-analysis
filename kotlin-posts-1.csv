Understanding traits in Kotlin <p>In <a href=\http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_%28programming_language%29\>Kotlin</a> we'll have possibility to create a \trait that may require a class being extended on the call side\, like </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I can't imagine any flow where I can apply this structure.

Reified generics in Scala 2.10 <p>The lack of reified generics in Scala is the thing that bugs me the most about the language, since <a href=\https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8582479/overloading-generic-event-handlers-in-scala\>simple things</a> cannot be implemented without using complicated constructs. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Both Kotlin and Ceylon supports reified generics so its definitely possible to do so on top of the JVM. In the <a href=\https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1357906/is-it-possible-for-scala-to-have-reified-generics-without-changing-the-jvm\>past</a> it was said that Scala could not support them without a change in the JVM, but now Scala 2.10 is <a href=\http://hacking-scala.posterous.com/new-features-in-scala-210\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>rumored</a> to have limited support for reification. So my question is:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>What can we expect for reification in Scala 2.10, will I for example be able to implement a <a href=\https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8582479/overloading-generic-event-handlers-in-scala\>generic trait multiple times</a> ?. Just how limited is it ?</li>&#xA;<li>If Scala 2.10's reification turns out to be more limited than <a href=\http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/Kotlin/Generics\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>Kotlin</a> and <a href=\http://relation.to/21406.lace\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>Ceylon</a>.

Java modifies kotlin class content to null <p>Kotlin has a brilliant null checks at compile time using separation to \nullable?\ and \notnullable\ objects.

kotlin function returning null <p>I am trying some android development with kotlin. In my case I want to overwrite: ContentProvider where I have to overwrite the function \query\.&#xA;\query\ returns \Cursor\ type. However, when I create the Cursor instance in the function with database.query I get back a \Cursor?\ type. So I can only return Cursor if it is not null, but what do I do if it is null?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is what it basically looks like:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Any Ideas how to solve that?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks,&#xA;Sven</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>&#xA;First of all thanks for the answers.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><em>Annotation</em> seems not to work in my case as I can only access the compiled code and I dont get the option to annotate the source. Maybe I am missing something here.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><em>Implementing my own cursor</em> Seems like overkill especially if I have to do it every time that problem occurs.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So it seems my only option is to return cursor!! But I dont know how exactly to do it. My code is a bit more complicated than in my example, I missed a when statement. This is an updated version:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Do I really have to implement my own cursor and clutter my code with useless \throw UnsupportedExceptions\?</p>&#xA;

Using Kotlin function as Java SAM type <p>When calling methods from a Java API that expect SAM (single abstract method) type arguments is there a consistent way to coerce a function literal to the correct type?

Is this down to the generic type making life difficult?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Maybe I'm expecting Kotlin to do something that it's not designed for but the first example shows that at least <em>some</em> SAM type coercion is possible (Kotlin fun to Ratpack ).</p>&#xA;

Scope of internal visibility modifier in Kotlin <p>I have a problem understanding the internal access modifier.

Generating jar for JavaFX project in Kotlin <p>While I was playing around with Kotlin I wondered if I can generat a jar for a JavaFX app written in Kotlin. So I wrote a simple app and it worked on IntelliJ IDEA, but when I decided to generate the jar it never worked! It says that it can't find or load the main class.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I guess the problem is that when it asked for the main class in the project settings I entered the application class name (which doesn't contain the main method, as it has to be at the package level) while in pure Java I could just put the main method inside the application class and it would work perfectly. So how should I get around this?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> just tried changing the target from JavaFX Application to a normal Jar and it worked. Don't know why it's not working with the JavaFX Application target.</p>&#xA;

Extend data class in Kotlin <p>Data classes seem to be the replacement to the old-fashioned POJOs in Java.

Leaving  annotation in only one of classes does not do the work, too.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Perhaps there is another idiom to extend data classes?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>UPD: I might annotate only child child class, but  annotation only handles properties declared in the constructor.

Lazy list in kotlin? <p>How can I achieve in a simple way a Lazy List in Kotlin ?

How to store temporary variable while initializing a Kotlin object? <p>I'm studying Kotlin and as part of learning it I want to design a class that would represent a rational number, requirements:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Class should contain two immutable integer fields: numerator and denominator.</li>&#xA;<li>Class should contain valid equals, hashCode and toString implementations.</li>&#xA;<li>When class is initialized, numerator and denominator should be deleted by their GCD (it means that  etc.)</li>&#xA;<li>This class should contain mul method that takes another Ratio and returns multiplication result of the current ratio and the given one.</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I tried to use data classes what looked suitable for that task, but I was stuck with inability to define a custom constructor (both numerator and denominator need to be deleted to their GCD).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Possible solution:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>What is the simplest way to define a class constructor so that GCD is calculated once?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>OK, it looks like I found the possible solution:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>but it renders that data qualifier useless - after this change Ratio class no longer has auto generated equals/hashCode/toString.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Verified on the latest version of Kotlin - 0.9.66</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Program that reproduces that behavior:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>output:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>that's clear that Ratio no longer has auto generated toString method</p>&#xA;

Use RxAndroid or RxKotlin when programming in Kotlin for Android? <p>I am going to start using reactive programming in my Android project. I am using Kotlin as primary language and now I would like to apply Rx. My first choice was RxAndroid but then I noticed that there is RxKotlin.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>As far as I know both are forked from RxJava so RxAndroid probably provides some API for android common tasks. On the other hand RxKotlin support lambas out of the box and allow me avoiding mixing kotlin with java.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Which one is preferred library in that case?   </p>&#xA;

Kotlin: Incremental compilation with Gradle <p>In the <a href=\http://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2014/10/m9-is-here/\>M9</a> announcement it was said that incremental compilation is now supported. Does this also work with Gradle, especially Android? If yes, how to enable it?</p>&#xA;
Reference to method of a particular instance in Kotlin <p>In Java 8 we can have a reference to a method of a Class' instance. Here's an example</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>a is an instance of the class  that has the method .</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Can we do the same in Kotlin? I tried the same syntax without success. So far I was only able to create an extension method reference like so:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But here I still need an instance of an  to invoke it. The other alterantive I see is defining a lambda like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;
Import nested objects / object functions in Kotlin <p>Let's say I have,</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And I want to use Moo by importing Foo, in Scala I would do:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>How can I do this in Kotlin?</p>&#xA;
Overloaded methods receiving higher order functions in Kotlin <p>Is it possible to have overloaded methods, each accepting a function and nothing else, eg</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>In Scala this is not possible, because the functions desugar to instances of , and due to erasure these methods cannot be disambiguated.

Kotlin reflection interoperability with Java <p>What are the caveats that a developer should be aware of while writing reflective code that works both with Java and Kotlin?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example, I have an existing library that uses reflection and it works well with Java. However, when I use the same with Kotlin, my reflective code doesn't seem to pick up the annotations on fields.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here are some of the differences that I noticed.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>1. Acquiring a Class instance</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Getting a Java class instance in Kotlin</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm unable to use the  facility or the  method in Kotlin as we do in Java.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>2. Delegates</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>When I use delegated properties in a Kotlin class, the properties that I retrieve have the  suffix. This is a bit contrary to the fields that we get in Java (I do understand Kotlin does not have fields, only properties). How does this affect meta-programming?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, with delegates I see that most of the methods retain their behavior as they do in Java. Are there any other differences that I have to be aware of?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Making Java and Kotlin interoperable for me would require understanding about <strong>1</strong> discussed above, plus other limitations / differences that Kotlin brings to meta-programming.</p>&#xA;
Is there an official Kotlin style guide? <p>I'm just getting into programming Kotlin and whenever I learn a new language I try to program the recommended way from the start (Sun's Java style guide, PEP8 for Python, etc). Is there something like this for Kotlin? I can't seem to find anything online that says one way or another.</p>&#xA;
Static extension methods in Kotlin <p>How do you define a static extension method in Kotlin? Is this even possible? I currently have an extension method as shown below.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The above extension can be invoked on an instance.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>but how do I make it static method like shown below.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;

Kotlin: best practice for parallel nullable / null safe trait or interface? <p>Consider the following simple trait:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now assume that I have a person class like so:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>If I build a library and I want to cater for both nullable and null-safe users, I'll end up with duplicates like these:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there a better way to achieve this? i.e a trait or library function that can handle both cases without duplicating everything?</p>&#xA;
Are nullable operators valid within generic class? <p>Kotlin has pretty features ( and ) handling nullable types. But this one just stroke me -- what if you don't know if you are dealing with nullable or non-nullable type? What if you have generics class , then you just have some type  and that's it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Does Kotlin allow to have \nullable\ operators applied to generic type ( here), does the type can be made nullable <strong>inside</strong> class (like ) and what if the class will be instantiated with nullable type -- like . Will it cause nullable of nullable (like pointer to pointer in C++ -- ) type within  type?</p>&#xA;
What is the place in type hierarchy of nullable types? <p>You can inherit type  from type , but whenever you define type  you will get type  (nullable on) for free. But where does it lie exactly in type hierarchy?  inherits from  or other way around? </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I ask this because I am puzzled with such code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I don't understand why line (@) is compiled? Or in other words I don't understand nullable types hierarchy then, because until now I though of  as  or any type derived from it. Can you derive non-nullable type from nullable one and what it would mean then?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Sorry if this is something obvious, I am just learning Kotlin.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><em>(@) for nullable types it should be .</em></p>&#xA;
Kotlin and Upper Type Bounds with Covariance <p>Does Kotlin support upper / lower type bounds in a covariance setting. Eg, I want to say</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>which in Scala would be</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But the compiler doesn't seem to like this, it complains about the covarianceness of the type parameter T.</p>&#xA;
How to call Java's String constructor (char[], int offset, int length) from Kotlin? <p>I am migrating some Java code to Kotlin, and I have trouble migrating a call to Java's String constructor  as it is not available in Kotlin.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Only  constructor seem to be available. How do I overcome this?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>P.S.</strong> I overcome this by writing:  and it seems that  and  are different. But it does not look so nice.</p>&#xA;
Accessing Kotlin extension functions from Java <p>Is it possible to access extension functions from Java code?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I defined the extension function in a Kotlin file.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Where  is a (generated) java class.&#xA;Now, I wanted to access it in my normal java code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, that doesn't work. <strong>The IDE won't recognize the  method and compilation fails.</strong> </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What does work is using with a static function from kotlin:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>by using  so my IDE seems to be configured correctly.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I searched through the whole Java-interop file from the kotlin docs and also googled a lot, but I couldn't find it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What am I doing wrong? Is this even possible?</p>&#xA;
Kotlin: Superclass is not accessible from trait <p>In Kotlin, given some class:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And a trait T that requires subclasses to extend A :</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>One would expect  to be able to call  or the more explicit , since all the type information is there , but instead it yields .</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Question:</strong> </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>[How] can I override some method from within the trait?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Of course, without overriding I could just do:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But I do want my trait to be able to \intercept / be in the middle\.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I had to use some delegate in order to achieve a similar behavior, but I'd like to know if it's possible to do this using traits.</p>&#xA;
AOP with Kotlin <p>I used AOP a lot with Java. It looks like that traditional java approaches can easily be reused with Kotlin. Given Kotlin emphasis on immutability JDK proxies seem to be the most feasible solution in Kotlin provided that you're following the same interface-first (better say trait-first in Kotlin) programming style, e.g.:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>So now one can easily write an aspect in, say, Spring/AOP and apply it to the instances of MyServiceImpl. It should be mentioned that Java interface-based generated proxies may be more favored by Kotlin developers as cglib requires to get rid of final (i.e. resort to open classes in Kotlin) and use parameterless public constructors for every class which should be wrapped by AOP proxies.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>At the same time Java interface-based generated proxies unfortunately impose significant performance penalty so I'm wondering if AOP programming can be done more intuitively or natively to Kotlin in some cases.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, consider the following example, when I want to use AOP for:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Logging arguments and return result of each method exposed from a service.</li>&#xA;<li>Starting transaction before function call and closing it after function call completes (commit/rollback depending on whether or not an exception has been thrown while making a particular service call).</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The most effective but unfortunately the most verbose brute-force solution in the aforementioned example with MyService/MyServiceImpl might look as follows:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The LoC complexity of that approach is O(N*K) where N is a number of method and K is a number of aspects that I want to apply.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So what I'm looking is a possible effective (both in terms of performance and LoC) solution for aspects in Kotlin preferrably without resorting to cglib-generated proxies as they impose too many limitations like saying goodbye to final classes and not having parameterless public constructors.</p>&#xA;
How to use Dagger's 2 @Named qualifier in Kotlin <p>Recently I had a problem with  qualifier in Kotlin.

How do I make IntelliJ respect Maven Kotlin plugin output directory? <p>I am writing Kotlin and compiling to JavaScript.  I also have some HTML/CSS resources.  I have a Maven project setup that copies my HTML resources to the build directory and the  has its  location set to be a subdirectory of the output directory ().

How do I do post-compile bundling in Maven? <p>I have a maven project that contains some Kotlin source files and some web resources (HTML/CSS).

How do I cast a JavaScript object to a Kotlin object? <p>I have received a JavaScript object in response to a remote HTTP request.

How do I test Kotlin code when compiling to JavaScript? <p>I have a Kotlin JavaScript project in IntelliJ (Ultimate).  I want to be able to write tests for this project.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have tried a number of different things ranging from writing tests with Spek (this would be ideal) to writing them in Karma/Jasmine.  The problem with Spek is that I could not get it to work with a JavaScript project.  It complains about some jars not being a JavaScript library.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The problem with Karma/Jasmine is that I couldn't figure out how to get the test runner to pick up the tests from my Kotlin test output.  When the tests are written in plain JavaScript, they can't access my Kotlin objects because I don't know how to reference them correctly with all of the name mangling that occurs when you do Kotlin to JavaScript compilation.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm open to anything at the moment, since this is an Angular project, I can probably figure out how to do end-to-end testing with Protractor, though I would really prefer some unit test coverage.</p>&#xA;
Generic casting in Kotlin <p>I have the following classes and interfaces:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And this analogous (I think?) Kotlin code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Note: MyActivityComponent implementation is always in Java so that Dagger can process it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The \problem\ is that MyActivity.getComponent() in Kotlin requires a cast to the return type even though  subclasses .</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My understanding of Kotlin's generics is admittedly weak, and I'm having trouble translating from Java's generics. Can someone explain why this cast is necessary or, preferably, the correct implementation which removes the need for casting?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I've also tried things like:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>and</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>With the same result (casting required).</p>&#xA;
Kotlin data class copy function not working <p>Maybe I'm misinterpreting how the  function of a  class works or maybe there's a bug, but the following is example of the  function not working as expected:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Kotlin:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Java</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>It seems that  is just making a new instance of  and not copying the values.

Kotlin: why do constructor parameters have \internal\ visibility by default? <p>If we have a class:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Its contructor parameter  is accessible through  (because it's also a property). If we want to restrict access to this property we should declare it as .</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Since in many cases from Java world (and if a class is not intended to be data class) fields which are assigned from constructor parameters are for private / protected use it feels like an additional effort to explicitely declare them  in Kotlin.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also, Kotlin classes are final by default, so why not follow this principle for properties? Am I missing something?</p>&#xA;

Is there a way to have a private file constant in Kotlin <p>Suppose I have some Utils.kt file which will contain only some utility functions, no classes, no objects.

Do Kotlin's access modifiers mean the same thing as in Java? <p>Kotlin has 3 keywords for access: ,  and . Do they mean the same thing as in Java, or are there differences? Also, is  the same as ?

What programming languages support implicit interface implementation by delegation? <p>Kotlin can do this very neat trick:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>which makes your class  implement , and all methods of  not implemented explicitly in  are automatically delegated to member .

Confusion with Kotlin generics <p>I'm new to Kotlin and I'm trying to write code which does something fairly simple, however I cannot figure out how to use generics to get it to work.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have a  trait which represents a handler for things. <strong><em>I cannot change the code for a Handler as it comes from a library</em></strong>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>All of the code below is in my control -</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p> is an open class that has subclasses such as  and  etc.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>A trait called  does something to create a List of AdminUsers and then passes the list to a handler for  -</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now I want to pass an  a handler for  instead of . Let's say the handler simply logs the names of the users, and doesn't do anything with Admin specific properties.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, this code gives me a <em>TypeMismatch</em>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Since the Handler is of the type  and is immutable, the preceding code should be completely safe, however the compiler isn't able to figure it out.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If I had access to the code for Handler I could do the following and it would work -</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, as I said before, I cannot modify Handler as it comes from a library. Also, it seems <em>hacky</em> to have to do this because the type of Handler is fully general and should be usable for other kinds of handlers too.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I tried subclassing Handler and using that -</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>However now I get an error that says <em>\Parameter T is declared as 'in' but occurs in 'invariant' position in Handler>\</em></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I tried -</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But that gives me more errors.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Why is this so confusing? And how can I use generics to get the preceding code to work?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I can make it work by writing a generic function that converts a  into  -</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And then -</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But, this seems so wasteful. Especially look at the body of the conversion function . It is doing <strong>nothing</strong>! Yet I have to go through the rigamarole of using it everytime just to satisfy the types.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there a better way? Is it technically possible to make the Kotlin compiler smarter so that this type jugglery is not needed?</p>&#xA;
How to reference \this\ within anonymous listeners when using short notation? <p>In Kotlin, is there a way to reference the listener instance when using this short notation for anonymous classes?

What access modifier for testable helper methods? <p>In Java, helper methods are often marked  instead of , so that unit tests within the same package can test the helper methods.

Subtype issues with generics in Kotlin <p>I have the following inheritance pattern in my code.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>When B and D return Sets, the compiler is able to determine that  is a subtype of both  and .

What are the limits on dynamic/double dispatch in Kotlin? <p>I'm just starting to explore Kotlin, and I'm curious about how far it moves beyond Java's core dynamic binding/dispatch semantics.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Let's say I write code that looks something like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Based on the above code--what can I expect to happen?  Do I get a failure at runtime because Horse doesn't implement add(Animal)?  Can it accurately differentiate them in calls of the above nature, where the compile-time type of the values being compared was Animal (at least, as written) but their runtime types were more specific?  Does it change anything if we used var instead of val?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks in advance.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>EDIT: Modified core code--I see the problem the first responder highlighted, I wasn't thinking straight.  Clearly I haven't actually compiled this, I'm still kind of exploring at a conceptual level.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also, I will give it a shot in the actual compiler, but I'm concerned that there will be situations in which it works and others in which it doesn't based on some criteria that I don't fully understand.  I wasn't able to find reference docs on how dynamic dispatch is implemented in Kotlin (not sure about it for Java either, for that matter; I wrote something a few months ago that I thought would work based on JVM docs, but it didn't, and I never had a chance to explore exactly why).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Anyhow thanks again!</p>&#xA;

Access property delegate in Kotlin <p>Kotlin has delegated properties which is a very nice feature. But sometimes  and  methods are not enough. Let's say I want to create a  object lazily and to close it later. Here's an example of how such delegate property could be implemented:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And that's how I would like to use it:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Unfortunately, this approach doesn't work because it seems that Kotlin doesn't allow to access property delegates directly. Is there any way to do what I want? Or are there any plans to add such functionality to Kotlin because it would be such a neat feature.</p>&#xA;
Partial class delegation in Kotlin <p>How do I partial delegate methods/fields in Kotlin? </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>To be specific: here I am trying to inherit class  from interface  and implement field  in the wrapper . That would clean up the  implementation, because  is just a state field. Note that  can't be a class because I want to use several such interfaces: </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The alternative is to implement all in one place:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there a way/pattern that would solve that problem with easy and as little code as possible? Code/bytecode generation is not an option for me.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><em>UPDATE</em></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I was not very clear about that, but please note that  is <strong><em>unique</em></strong> for every .</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So I may suggest a 'half-bad' solution with run-time assertions:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The question is still open, since a really good solution would check that  at compilation time.</p>&#xA;

Does \internal\ visibility modifier in Kotlin work yet? <p>Assuming a module in Kotlin means a project (though it would be good to see what the exact definition of a Kotlin module means .. unclear from docs) ...</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Do Kotlin visibility modifiers work yet. I have two projects, a main project and a test project, with different, non overlapping, package paths. The test project is dependent on the main project (in Eclipse). It does not seem to matter whether the interfaces or classes in the main project are marked  or not. In the test project the main project interfaces/classes are visibile/accessible not matter what. The only difference shows up if you mark the main project ones  and then there is a visibility issues. But with or without  it doesn't seem to make any difference.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>From what I can make out from the docs, omitting a visibility modifier on an interface or class effects the default visibility, i.e. .</p>&#xA;
Kotlin companion objects and reflection <p>Ran into something interesting when using companion objects and Java reflection.

Kotlin for game dev <p>Background:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm always searching for a language to replace Java for game development. Kotlin looks promising with a good IDE support and Java interop. But one of the FPS killers for a game (on Android especially) is GC usage. So, some libraries (like libgdx) are using pools of objects, custom collections and other tricks to avoid frequent GC run. For Java that can be done in a clear way. Some other JVM languages espesially with functional support using a lot of GC by it's nature, so it is hard to avoid.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Questions:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>Does Kotlin creates any invisible GC overhead in comparison to Java?</li>&#xA;<li>Which features of Kotlin is better to avoid to have less GC work?</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;

How to replace a FrameLayout with a fragment with Kotlin on Android <p>I'm trying to develop an Android app with Kotlin, but I've hit a bit of a snag when trying to dynamically move fragments around. What I'm trying to do is replace a FrameLayout in an Activity's layout with a fragment. Currently whenever I try to run my app it just shows a white screen under the toolbar leading me to believe that the fragment is not being added to the FrameLayout the way I expected.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here is my main Activity where I do the first transaction:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here is the fragment I'm attempting to create. It simply inflates a view while adding a callback for when a button is pressed:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here's the layout that the main Activity uses with setContentView:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And lastly here's the layout that the fragment is inflating:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\1.0\ encoding=\utf-8\?&gt;&#xA;&lt;LinearLayout xmlns:android=\http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\&#xA;    android:layout_width=\match_parent\&#xA;    android:layout_height=\match_parent\&#xA;    android:orientation=\vertical\ &gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;EditText&#xA;        android:id=\@
Kotlin: unit test assert object after gson <p>I have JUnit test like that:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>service is <a href=\http://square.github.io/retrofit/\ rel=\noreferrer\>Retrofit</a>, that uses GsonConverter to deserialize json into </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>instances.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Test is passing, even if ACategory filled with id = null, title = null etc.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, as far as i know, gson using reflection, and kotlin lazily resolves this nullability constraints on first access.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there any way to force this resolve?&#xA;Some good-looking solution without direct access to fields manually? I really don't want to write every assert by hand.</p>&#xA;

Kotlin Android extensions and retained fragment <p>I am using <a href=\http://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/android-plugin.html\>Kotlin Android extensions</a> in my project and I came across some behavior that I am unable to understand. I use this code to retain my fragment in the activity:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is the retained :</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>and its XML layout <strong>hello.xml</strong>:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Everything works as expected – the  displays <em>Hello world!</em> on screen on the first launch. But when you rotate the screen the  does not work. This is weird because  is not nullable and has to reffer to some view. If you remove  and leave the fragment recreate every time this problem disappears. Any thoughts what might cause this problem?</p>&#xA;
How can I get the name of a Kotlin property? <p>I have the following function to access a property's delegate. It uses Kotlin reflection to get a property's name and Java reflection to get the field.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The method is used like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, I would prefer to use it like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The problem with the code above is getting the property name of  and getting the instance  from . From what I know about Kotlin, this is probably not possible, however I'd like to see if I can clean up my function at all.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>To give a bigger picture of what I'm trying do here's my complete code. I want an observable delegate to which I can add and remove observers using the delegate reference and without creating addition variables.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<h2><strong><em>Edit</em></strong>:</h2>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I just realized that the function also isn't strict because the property delegate field name is referenced by  name, which doesn't require a strong reference to the enclosing class. Here's an example to demonstrate the problem:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This compiles and runs without error because  and  both result in a field string of .</p>&#xA;
Invoking Java function with vararg not compiling in Kotlin <p>I'm trying to call a Java method from Kotlin but the compiler doesn't manage to find the proper signature. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The method has 2 signatures : </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Then in kotlin I just want to call this, which seems completely valid to me :</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But the compiler say</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I read Kotlin and Java method with vararg have some interrop issues, is there a way to fix that without using a java class as a bridge ?</p>&#xA;
Kotlin Annotation Processing: is it possible to generate an extension method? <p>I'm playing around with Kotlin and I think that it would be great to have \<em>functional classes</em>\, see the example of what I want:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre class=\lang-scala prettyprint-override\></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The idea is that I would be able to use it like:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre class=\lang-scala prettyprint-override\></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If I were to write  which I want by myself, the resulting class would be:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre class=\lang-scala prettyprint-override\></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But it's tedious a bit to write this by hands in every \<em>functional class</em>\.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So here's my question: is it possible to make  an annotation and then process it adding  method with the desired code?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I know that <strong>kapt</strong> can be used for Kotlin annotation processing, but AFAIK for now it cannot generate Kotlin code and there's no way to make an extension function in Java generated code.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there any way to generate a new Kotlin method for a class?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><em>Node: I understand that the idea of functional classes has few use cases and that it's not that hard to add the mentioned  method manually, but for me it's academical interest to the concept of annotation processing in Kotlin.</em></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>UPD: Just my thought about functional classes: there's language feature of delegating interfaces and it would work good here, but  reference is not visible in that block. Example:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre class=\lang-scala prettyprint-override\></pre>&#xA;

Composing network request with RX and Kotlin <p>I am working on an Android application that uses kotlin with RXJava and Retrofit for network calls.

Kotlin uses runtime assertions for null checking - Performance overhead? <p>I'm considering Kotlin for a simulation framework and noticed that the compiler interweaves static checkParameterIsNotNull calls after for each method which can be accessed from java.

Now that in a typical simulation framework the count of runs might be in the millions, I'm wondering about the performance impact of such a feature.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If there an option to turn it off?</p>&#xA;

Kotlin Code compiled to Jar to be used for Java Project? <p>I've written a Java library in Kotlin, and I'd like to compile it to a jar that is usable by Java and Kotlin applications.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The idea is that the jar should be able to work on Java projects, and Kotlin projects. Doing a simple  generates a jar, and when I inspect the jar I can see several imports that aren't included in the jar that normal Java applications won't have access too:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>How could I include the above dependencies in the jar? Right now the jar is only 30kb. I'd prefer to not have to include the entire Kotlin runtime either, but only compile in the used components.</p>&#xA;
Can we access the PropertyMetaData of any property in kotlin? <p>Is there a way in kotlin to access the  from outside of a property? To be more specific, from the delegation? &#xA;Looking for something like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>EDIT (a more suitable example now)</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>EDIT (after 1.0.0-beta-1038)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This code snippet worked like a charm before (note: the String \scrollPlace\ was not passed explicitly when using the previous version of kotlin since the property name was passed \implicitly\ before):</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>In this example I'm using some chaining. The extension function injectBy (which is based on the pattern suggested under 1) of the accepted answer, except for passing a custom string ) creates a O2dInjectionClosure (ReadOnlyProperty) instance. The solution 1) would work of course, even though it's not as convenient as with the use of propertyDelgated, but the chaining causes some trouble. At least a proper solution haven't come to my mind yet. The extension function replaceBy creates another new O2dInjectionClosure instance:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thus, I somehow would like to do the necessary stuff on the last call of the chaining, but in a convenient way :).&#xA;I hope it's somehow reasonable</p>&#xA;
How to pass compiler arguments to Kotlin Compiler with Gradle <p>I'm compiling a Kotlin library jar with Gradle using the Kotlin gradle plugin:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm trying to find a way to pass a simple  compiler arguments to the kotlin compiler. I can't seem to find any documentation on this at all. I tried mimicking the java plugin, but that didn't seem to work. <a href=\http://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/command-line.html\ rel=\noreferrer\>Here</a> is some documentation about working with the command line compiler, but the gradle documentation doesn't mention anything about passing compiler arguments.</p>&#xA;
Property getter typed on Supertype instead of Implementation in Kotlin <p>Suppose I have two classes, a and a which extends .</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>How would I create a <strong>private property for the concrete -Type (for internal use)</strong>, with a <strong>public getter typed as the -Type</strong>, to achieve polymorphism? My initial approach was like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, the Kotlin compiler complains:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><em>Error:(30, 11) Kotlin: Getter return type must be equal to the type of the property, i.e. 'mypackage.Impl'</em></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Basically, this is what it would look like in plain Java:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>How could one achieve this? Am I missing something?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>P.S. I am aware of Backing Fields and creating custom methods as a workaround for getter, I was just curious on how to approach this in an elegant, Kotlin style manner.</p>&#xA;
How to create caching/hot version of rx.Single? <p>The RxJava <a href=\https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/releases/tag/v1.0.13\>v1.0.13</a> introduced new type of an Observable: <strong>rx.Single</strong>. It fits great the request-response model but lacks the standard side-effects introducing operators like doOnNext(). So, it's much harder to make multiple things happen as a result.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My idea was to replace doOnNext() with multiple subscriptions to the same Single instance. But this can cause the underlaying work to be done multiple times: once per every subscription.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Example rx.Single implementation:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Usage:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is it possible to create a instance of Single that will not fetchSomeData() multiple times even when single.subscribe() is called multiple times, but cache and return the same result?</p>&#xA;

Writing Apps for Android with Swift <p>First of all I'm focused on iOS but but I've done ~2 apps for android in Java and it was horrible. I can't explain it why. Was it Java or Android itself but I hate it so much that when now I have to write another app for Android so I'm looking every option for me. This is what I found:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li><strong>Kotlin</strong> - people said this is \Swift for android\ but I still stuck with Android libraries.</li>&#xA;<li><strong>Silver</strong> - \you can use Swift to write code directly against the .NET, Java, Android and Cocoa APIs. And you can also share a lot of non-UI code between platforms.\ But at this moment I've trouble with download it. </li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What's your opinion in this matter? </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Do you have any experience with those two solutions?</p>&#xA;
Kotlin accessing constant in inner class from Java <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This issue has been resolved since Kotlin 1.0 beta version (at least). Keeping the rest of the contents intact for historical reason.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm using Kotlin with Android and I'm trying to use some constants from the SDK, like this one:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>It doesn't see AudioSource, so it doesn't see the MIC as well. I've tried changing the imports, cleaning the project. Nothing worked so far. I've temporarily solved it by importing it in a Java class, which worked just fine, and then I just refer to my Java class from my Kotlin file,but I would really like to know why this happens and how I can avoid having that Java class.</p>&#xA;
Kotlin overload resolution ambiguity in the standard library <p>In Kotlin 0.12.1230 it appears that deprecated APIs are blocking the use of their replacements.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example, the compiler complains about the following snippet because it \cannot choose among... candidates without completing type inference\</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The candidates are  and  both of which have identical signatures and  extends .  Furthermore,  is deprecated in favor of .</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Attempting to resolve the type inference ambiguity, like you see below, results in the compiler complaining about \overload resolution ambiguity\.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there any way to resolve the ambiguity while we wait for deprecated APIs to disappear entirely?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It seems that casting to the least specific type, in this case the deprecated type , accomplishes it, but now my code explicitly depends on a deprecated type when I have no desire to do so:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Hopefully there is a better way?</p>&#xA;
Dagger 2 in Unit tests with Kotlin <p>In <a href=\http://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2015/05/kapt-annotation-processing-for-kotlin/\ rel=\nofollow\>Kotlin Blog</a> there is explanation how to make Dagger 2 work with Kotlin.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Everything worked like charm.

Kotlin with JPA: default constructor hell <p>As JPA requires,  classes should have a default (non-arg) constructor to instantiate the objects when retrieving them from the database.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In Kotlin, properties are very convenient to declare within the primary constructor, as in the following example:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But when the non-arg constructor is declared as a secondary one it requires values for the primary constructor to be passed, so some valid values are needed for them, like here:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>In case when the properties have some more complex type than just  and  and they're non-nullable, it looks totally bad to provide the values for them, especially when there's much code in primary constructor and  blocks and when the parameters are actively used -- when they're to be reassigned through reflection most of the code is going to be executed again.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Moreover, -properties cannot be reassigned after the constructor executes, so immutability is also lost.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So the question is: how can Kotlin code be adapted to work with JPA without code duplication, choosing \magic\ initial values and loss of immutability?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>P.S. Is it true that Hibernate aside of JPA can construct objects with no default constructor?</p>&#xA;
How to mimic or achieve IS-A relationships for Kotlin data classes <p>I have been exploring Kotlin and have written a small program/script that does a task I find boring.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In the development of the program I use data classes to represent a Playlist. at one point in the design I wanted to have a special type of  that was .</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I couldn't get this to work.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How would you achieve this relationship with Kotlin?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In Java, I would just extend  (or perhaps create an interface/abstract class for them both to inherit from).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I just wanted to be able to have a  rather than </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In the end I just created a  object, but I am interested in if it is possible to create IS-A hierarchies with data classes.</p>&#xA;
Adding a 'provided' configuration to a kotlin/java library using gradle <p>I have a java library to which I've added a 'provided' configuration using gradle.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Everything works as expected with this setup.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now I want to start using kotlin in my library, so I modified the build script to look like this (sans pluses)</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Without even adding any kotlin files (and even if I do), the library no longer compiles saying that it can't find the classes in the provided library (android in my case). </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What do I need to change to get it so that the provided dependencies are recognized again?</p>&#xA;
RxJava: onBackpressureBlock() strange behavior <p>I am playing around with RxJava (RxKotlin to be precise). Here I have the following s:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And I'd like to have a few of them merged and running concurrently. They ignore backpressure so the backpressure operators have to be applied to them.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Then I create</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And then I merge the s:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The first one is supposed to emit items incessantly.&#xA;If I do so in the last 3 seconds of the run I get the following output:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Seems that the s are subscribed on the same one thread, and the first observable is blocked for 3+ seconds.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But when I swap  and  calls the output becomes what I expected, the output gets merged during the whole execution.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It's obvious to me that calls order matters in RxJava, but I don't quite understand what happens in this particular situation.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So what happens when  operator is applied <em>before</em>  and what if <em>after</em>?</p>&#xA;
What's the difference between an object and a data object? <p>The other day I noticed that I sometimes put  in front of s and other times not:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>What's the difference between an  and a ?</p>&#xA;
Does Kotlin have an identity function? <p>Scala has a generic  function in the Predef:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Does Kotlin have a similar facility in the standard library? Of course I could simply use  instead, but I find  easier to read, and instantiating all those lambdas is a little wasteful.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I must be able to use this  function in places where a function  is expected, for any type . Is such a function even possible in Kotlin's type system? (In the case of Scala, there is an implicit conversion that wraps the method inside a function object or something.)</p>&#xA;
Spring constructor annotations on Kotlin data class with default values <p>To use spring persistence but maintain immutable types I've added the PersistenceConstructor annotation to my data classes. This tells spring to use that constructor when loading classes from the database.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, I'm having trouble getting spring to find the constructor. </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This works 100% of the time on my machine but when deployed to heroku it consistently fails. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It looks like, by having default values for parameters kotlin generates more than one constructors but the problem is that each constructor get the annotation applied to them so it's just luck (or jdk implementation specific) which one spring picks up. The default one has no names for the parameters so Spring doesn't know what to do with it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My real constructors are larger than this so it would be a pain to not have default values. Is there a way to get the annotation to only apply to the constructor without default values? </p>&#xA;
`break` and `continue` in `forEach` in Kotlin <p>Kotlin has very nice iterating functions, like  or , but I am not able to make the  and  operators work with them (both local and non-local):</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The goal is to mimic usual loops with the functional syntax as close as it might be. It was definitely possible in some older versions of Kotlin, but I struggle to reproduce the syntax. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The problem might be a bug with labels (M12), but I think that the first example should work anyway.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It seems to me that I've read somewhere about a special trick/annotation, but I could not find any reference on the subject. Might look like the following:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;
Function declaration error when compiling with Kotlin 12 <p>I've inherited an older Kotlin codebase, and attempting to compile with the newest compiler had many issues. The one that I'm having trouble figuring out are these strange functions that are hanging out in the middle of a class, without any apparent call. I'm wondering if anyone knows what this used to be, and what it was replaced with in newer versions of Kotlin?</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Specifically, the lines in question are the  and  , both in-between braces just hanging out.</p>&#xA;
Idiomatic way to spilt sequence into three lists using Kotlin <p>So this is possibly more about functional programming than Kotlin, I am at that stage were a little knowledge is dangerous, and I wrote the app in Kotlin so seems fair to ask a Kotlin question as its Kotlins structures that i am interested in.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have a sequence of items, they are in batches of three, so the stream may look like </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>What I want to do is to spilt this into three lists, currently I am doing this by partitioning into two lists, one that contains the numbers and one that contains everything else, then taking the second half of the result, the letters and symbols and partitioning again, into letters and symbols, thus i end up with three lists.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This strikes me as somewhat inefficient, maybe a functional approach isn't the best approach here.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there an efficient way of doing this, are my choices, this or a for loop?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks</p>&#xA;
Kotlin: Why can't I do an assignment in a loop guard? <p>Why is this syntax not valid? The error IntelliJ reports is that only expressions are allowed in such context (line 2).

It seems to only happen to my Kotlin project.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Any ideas?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks in advance.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<h2>Update:</h2>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I've found that the problem is being caused by the Kotlin Android plugin. The problem disappears when I remove  from the module's  file and comes back when I reinsert it. Feel free to offer any insight into this.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<h2>Update 2:</h2>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The last update isn't the cause. I found that if a project contains a Kotlin file then rebuilding and cleaning fails. It continues to fail, even if all the Kotlin files are removed, until the background Java process is killed, meaning it has some kind of lock on the build files. I submitted a bug here with more details and steps to reproduce the bug: <a href=\https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-9440\>KT-9440</a></p>&#xA;

Kotlin Quasar topic and channel blocking issue <p>I was playing with Quasar in Kotlin and got to working with topics and channels. I was following some Java examples and wrote a little snippet.

Does butterknife 7.x work with Kotlin M14? <p>I'm trying to use Butterknife with some Kotlin code and also Java code. I know that before M12, there was bad or no support for annotation processing that ButterKnife required. So I have kept my activities in Java. It was working at least in Java with Butterknife 6.x and preM12 Kotlin.&#xA;I'm trying now butterknife 7.x with M13 and M14. It should have even annotation processing support, but it's not working for me.   function doesn't bind anything in my adapter which is written in Java nor in activity written in Kotlin.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm using this in build.gradle (tried latest version on Github):</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This doesn't compile. I tried also 'com.neenbedankt.android-apt' which does compile but binding is not working.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I know that there is probably not support in <em>butterknife</em> for that yet. But is there any hack to get it working?</p>&#xA;

Kotlin lateinit properties, NPE danger? <p>I am using lateinit properties in order to avoid continuous null checking with the ? operator.

Kotlin Map: why is there no toHashMap()? <p>In Kotlin,  class has  and  extension methods.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But why is there no  method? In fact, the resulting  implementation of many stdlib methods is , but casting it to  in my code would make me rely on the implementation which is bad.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Introducing such a method would keep developers safe from digging into the implementation, and with the current implementation it would just perform the cast.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My use case is:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>When I use  it leads to overhead of creating a new map, which I'd be happy to avoid.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, is it by design?</p>&#xA;

How to create re-usable library <p>I want to create a kotlin library that can be re-used across my android apps.  However I don't want it to be an android library since I was hoping to hook it up to some testing and mocking frameworks.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In my android app, I right-clicked on the top-level app node and did new -> Module and then selected 'Java Library'.  However in the new java library it seems like Kotlin is only partially being supported.  Syntax for the most part works but other things don't.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For instance, forEach on my hash map is unresolved as well as attempting to index it such as items[0].  Am I going about this the right way?  </p>&#xA;
What are the Kotlin class initialisation semantics? <p>I haven't been able to find anything in the language definition that explains the initialisation of a class in Kotlin.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The results of running this program change depending whether the property is initialised at (1) or at (2).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm surprised that the declaration order is relevant in the language and would like to understand the decisions behind this.  My expectation would be that properties are initialised before the constructor body is invoked.</p>&#xA;
Create an annotation instance in Kotlin <p>I have a framework written in Java that, using reflection, get the fields on an annotation and make some decisions based on them. At some point I am also able to create an ad-hoc instance of the annotation and set the fields myself. This part looks something like this:&#xA;</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now I am trying to do the exact thing in Kotlin. Bear in mind that the annotation is in a third party jar.&#xA;Anyway, here is how I tried it in Kotlin:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But the compiler complains about: Annotation class cannot be instantiated</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So the question is: how should I do this in Kotlin?</p>&#xA;
Kotlin object.

Why Kotlin compiler requires the explicit initializer of var property? <p>I can't understand the following piece of Kotlin documentation:  </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The only explanation of why the compiler requires explicit initializer here (at least the only explanation I can come up with) is that Kotlin does not have default values of properties. Is it right? If so, why? In other words: what is the difference between Kotlin properties and Java fields (which have default values) which doesn't allow us to have default values of properties?</p>&#xA;
In Kotlin how do I groupBy type <p>I would like to group a list by the subtypes of its generic type argument.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>That is a have a list with three types of objects all are a subtype of some type A.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The closest I can get is  or </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The former creates keys of Strings which isn't ideal, but I can deal with.

Things are different since Kotlin 1.0.0. See @Jayson Minard's writing below for a Kotlin 1.0.0 answer.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In Java 8 code that uses Stream, I write things like </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But in similar code written in Kotlin, I get unexpected results.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Why would the return value of the  expression be of a different list type in the Kotlin code than in the Java code?

Kotlin: Cannot import-on-demand from object <p>I am trying to make a library where you can call functions of an  through \static imports\ (import-on-demand in Kotlin).

How to instantiate a Kotlin generic <p>In Kotlin, how do one instantiate a generic?  In C# and Java this task is very simple and I feel really stupid for not being able to do this in any way I have tried.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Note that I have no control over the derivation of the \underlying\ Kotlin generic and hence cannot use variance; that which I can however guarantee is that it is an instantiable Kotlin class (not Java) which does have a zero argument constructor.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also note that I have read this already (without getting it to work): <a href=\https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-6728\ rel=\nofollow\>https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-6728</a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>A bit of opinion - really really like Kotlin after a week or two's play.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>C# Code / a very simple example.  Java is very similar:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre class=\lang-cs prettyprint-override\></pre>&#xA;
Does kotlin support making a class implementing an interface outside of its definition file? <p>I see kotlin.List and kotlin.MutableList is implemented by java.util.ArrayList. But where did kotlin put this trick?

Kotlin and Immutable Collections? <p>I am learning Kotlin and it is looking likely I may want to use it as my primary language within the next year. However, I keep getting conflicting research that Kotlin does or does not have immutable collections and I'm trying to figure out if I need to use Google Guava. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Can someone please give me some guidance on this? Does it by default use Immutable collections? What operators return mutable or immutable collections? If not, are there plans to implement them?</p>&#xA;

how to access internal properties from java test code <p>I've got some class with property marked as internal. &#xA;Then I try to set that property from test code which is in java. &#xA;How can I access those properties? test code and class code are in the same package.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>example:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>test code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Android Studio is suggesting activity.setSomeProperty$production_sources_for_module_app();&#xA;but this also does not compile. </p>&#xA;
Kotlin- Single instance of a non-singleton class? <p>I was doing some experiments with Kotlin and I was playing with singleton patterns. I wanted to persist a single instance of a  object. Just like in Java, I thought I'd wrap a singleton around it. </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>What surprised me however is there seems to be no built-in way to compile getters for it (like properties for a class). It was just straight up exposing that  property to the world without any encapsulation, which I did not want. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I could just make it private and explicitly make my own getter (but I'm looking at Kotlin because I'm passionate about being lazy). However, I think I stumbled on another way to do this. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I could create a Kotlin file and declare a private variable and a public function to encapsulate and expose it safely, without putting it in any class or singleton at all!</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The thing is it just feels way too easy. I feel like I'm doing something bad. But at the same time this makes sense. Nobody likes calling  a hundred times. Is this pattern I discovered valid and not an anti-pattern?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also, is there any way to compile getters and encapsulate final properties on the singleton? Or do I implement those methods myself?</p>&#xA;
Can I add operators to existing classes? <p>In Kotlin, I would like to add an  method to an existing class that hasn't got an  implementation yet.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In my case I would like to compare two  instances.

Thus  for all .</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href=\https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/operator-overloading.html\ rel=\nofollow\>The documentation states that operators can be defined by extension methods</a>:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p> doesn't provide an  method.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So I wrote:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>However this extension gets ignored.

Is it considered idiomatic to always prefer properties over backing fields? <p>I recently converted an Android project from Java to Kotlin using Android Studio's Kotlin plugin.

Protected members not accessible in extension functions? <p>Kotlin features a couple of <a href=\https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/visibility-modifiers.html\ rel=\nofollow\>visibility modifiers</a> as well as <a href=\https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html\ rel=\nofollow\>extension functions</a>. The documentation states that . But what does this mean for the visibility of class members within extension functions?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Let's consider the following contrived example:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The code will not compile. It seems that protected members are not accessible when extending the class.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So does <em>resolved statically</em> mean the extension function is syntactic sugar for having something like this in Java:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This would explain why protected members aren't accessible.

How to delegate implementation to a property in Kotlin? <p>Kotlin enables me to implement an interface by delegating to a primary constructor argument like so:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But this exhibits the backing implementer to the user.

Why doesn't smart-cast handle this situation? <p>I have some code with a similar structure to this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>From my understanding, smart casting should infer that in the final 'else' statement, neither a nor b can be null, yet it doesn't seem to infer this which results in an error.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there a legitimate reason that smartcasting isn't working in the way I expect here, or is it just not as smart as I think it is?</p>&#xA;

What's Kotlin's compatibility policy? <p>Once Kotlin 1.0 is out, what will be the compatibility policy? As a user, I hope Kotlin would keep its compatibility, either in source or binary. Just as serious as Java.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>On contrast, Scala is a bad example. Failing to keep its binary compatibility between minor versions drove me away. And I believe a lot of users have left Scala partly because of its compatibility issue. This caused many libraries (including SBT at my time) cannot provide a complete suite of distributions for the whole series of Scala versions. This is just binary compatibility issue. Imagine if source compatibility was broken.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have decided to use Kotlin in my company's commercial project. So I really need to be sure Kotlin is <strong>serious</strong> about keeping compatibility, instead of pursuing beauty.</p>&#xA;

Fragment instance is retained but child fragment is not re-attached <p><strong>Update:</strong> accepted answer points to explanation (bug) with a work-around, but also see my Kotlin based work-around attached as an answer below.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This code is in Kotlin, but I think it is a basic android fragment life-cycle issue.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have a Fragment that holds a reference to an other \subfragment\</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here is basically what I am doing:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>I have a main fragment that has  set to true</li>&#xA;<li>I have a field in the main fragment that will hold a reference to the subfragment, initially this field is null</li>&#xA;<li>In the main fragment's , I check to see if the subfragment field is null, if so, I create an instance of the subFragment and assign it to the field</li>&#xA;<li>Finally I add the subfragment to a container in the layout of the main fragment.</li>&#xA;<li>If the field is not null, ie we are in onCreateView due to a configuration change, I don't re-create the subfragment, I just try to added it to the containter.</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>When the device is rotated, I do observe the  and  methods of the subfragment being called, but I don't see any lifecyle methods being called on the subfragment during the process of adding the retained reference to the subfragment, to the child_container when the main fragments view is re-created. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The net affect is that I don't see the subfragment view in the main fragment.  If I comment out the if (subfragment == null) and just create a new subfragment everytime, i <strong>do</strong> see the subfragment in the view.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<h2>Update</h2>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The answer below does point out a bug, in which the childFragmentManager is not retained on configuration changes.  This will ultimately break my intended usage, which was to preserve the backstack after rotation, however I think what I am seeing is something different.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I added code to the activities  method and I see something like this when the app is first launched:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>and then after rotation:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>here fm is the childFragmentManager, and as you can see, we still have the same instance of Tab1Fragment, but it has a new childFragmentManager, which I think is unwanted and due to the bug reported in the answer below.&#xA;The thing is that I <strong>did</strong> add the subfragment to this <strong>new</strong> childFragmentManger.&#xA;So it seems like the transaction never executes with the reference to the fragment that was retained,  but does complete if I create a brand new fragment.

What is the Kotlin equivalent of Java Stream.collect? <p>If I want to collect my Kotlin collection into something that isn't built into the stdlib, how do I do it?</p>&#xA;

What are good examples that really match the cases such as documented for Java 8 ?

Kotlin extension functions by type <p>What is the idiomatic way to add a function to a class based on type. The following example uses List as the class, and the Type Parameter  is the class of objects inside of the list. Lets say you want to sort each of these lists with a different comparator based on their type. </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This gives an error saying that both sort functions have the same signatures due to Java's overloading rules. In Java I might give them both different identifiable names but it is fairly ugly as Kotlin extensions (e.g. a.sortA() b.sortB()). Kotlin doesn't show sortA to a List&lt; B > so there seems like there would be a better way of writing sort() to handle different comparators on different objects.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The example is pretty simple but imagine if I don't have access to modify class A and B so I could not use inheritance or implement an interface on them. I also thought about adding a comparator to every class and use Any? But that seems cumbersome as well.</p>&#xA;

I find this counter intuitive: I pass a non-null value to the primary constructor, yet in the init block of the super class it resolves to null?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I think I have a vague idea of what might be going on: since  serves both as a constructor argument as well as a property, the assignment internally calls , but  isn't fully initialized yet.

(Kind of like <a href=\https://github.com/vert-x/mod-lang-groovy/blob/master/src/main/groovy/org/vertx/groovy/platform/impl/GroovyVerticleFactory.groovy#L141\ rel=\nofollow\>Groovy</a> does.) If not, do you have any useful compiler arguments suggestions or pretty much any advices?</p>&#xA;

Use default argument value in Kotlin function call <p>Just started up with some Kotlin tutorials and am super excited to use Kotlin.

Kotlin - Intermittent \bad class file\ error <p>Starting today, when I attempt to build my Kotlin Android app, I am met with the following error in my Gradle build:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>It is pointing to an inner class Baz which extends android.support.v4.app.FragmentStatePagerAdapter. I am able to temporarily get around the error by commenting out the class, and any references to it in the outer class, and rebuilding. The error goes away, but obviously the class no longer exists so other things break at runtime. Then, if I uncomment it and build, it will work for a few builds. Then the error comes back. Rinse and repeat. I think closing the Genymotion emulator may trigger it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Anyone else run into this, or have any ideas?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here is the offending code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>EDIT: Apologies, Baz extends FragmentStatePagerAdapter, not Fragment as I initially stated.

How to generate a kotlin file from an annotation processor? <p>I have a java annotation processor which generates a bunch of java files during compilation. I'd like to make the generated classes nicer to use in kotlin by adding extension methods.

I've tried this, I used the  object to create this file outputting it to the StandardLocations.SOURCE_OUTPUT directory. Intellij can see my generated class, and I can use the extension functions as intended, but the app won't compile because the compiler can't find the new kotlin file. Is there any way I can write a new kotlin file that'll get picked up by the kotlin compiler? </p>&#xA;

Where/How do You Add Documentation for Kotlin Packages? <p>In Java, if you want to document a package, it has to be put into the package-info.class file.

When should one prefer Kotlin extension functions? <p>In Kotlin, a function with at least one argument can be defined either as a regular non-member function or as an <a href=\https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html#extension-functions\ rel=\noreferrer\>extension function</a> with one argument being a receiver.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>As to the scoping, there seems to be no difference: both can be declared inside or outside classes and other functions, and both can or cannot have visibility modifiers equally.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Language reference seems not to recommend using regular functions or extension functions for different situations.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, my question is: <strong>when do extension functions give advantage over regular non-member ones?</strong> And when regular ones over extensions?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p> vs .</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is it just a hint of a function semantics (receiver is definitely in focus) or are there cases when using extensions functions makes code much cleaner/opens up opportunities?</p>&#xA;

Kotlin object (singleton) with an Android Application Context <p>I've been looking into Android development using Kotlin and I ran into a situation. I'm trying to figure out how to create a singleton using the recommended Kotlin \object\ and pass it an Android Context, more specifically the context from the Context.getApplicationContext() method.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It's essentially the same question as <a href=\https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33128024/singleton-with-argument-in-kotlin\>here</a>, but since Kotlin was in beta until just a few days ago, I was wondering if the answer might have changed for V1.0.0.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'd rather not use the accepted answer in the referred question (use a setter to set the context) because it would mean I'd have to (re)set the context to make sure it's not null before using the singleton. Not a big deal, but it feels like there should be a better way. It might also raise issues when setting the context from different threads at the same time...? Or maybe not, since the Context would always be the same Application Context.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Using an injection library as suggested in the other answer to that question would work, but I'm looking for a more \idiomatic\ way of doing this since I'm trying to learn the language.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Anyone know another way?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks!</p>&#xA;

I use Jackson-Kotlin module to help serialize Kotlin data classes using constructors.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here's an example of a dataclass that serializes just fine:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here's an example of a similar class that fails to deserialize:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Following exception is thrown by Jongo because Jackson deserialization fails:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>It does work if I fully annotate the Session data class like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>My question is, why does it work for Workflow? What's the subtle difference that makes unmarshalling fail for Session data class, when it's not fully annotated?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Difference was that I tested Workflow test case running it from Gradle, which used different version of Kotlin then the Session test case that I run from IDEA IDE. Update of IDEA's Kotlin plugin also updated Kotlin version that IDEA uses to run test cases, which I didn't notice. This resulted in mismatched versions of Kotlin and Jackson-Kotlin library. Accepted answer below pointed out what needs to be configured in order get things working again. </p>&#xA;

Hadoop Context type parameters in Kotlin <p>When implementing a Hadoop Mapper or Reducer in Kotlin, I get an interesting contradiction from the compiler.

Comparing lists of comparables in Kotlin <p>I'm trying to write a function that compares two lists of comparables. The comparables can be of various types as long as the elements at the same positions in the two lists being compared are comparable. Example:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This should print -1 because </p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>10 == 10</li>&#xA;<li>\xyz\ == \xyz\</li>&#xA;<li>'a' &lt; 'b'</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>and thus list1 &lt; list2.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here's the code that I have put together with a bit of a trial and error process since I'm a little bit confused about how generics work in this specific case:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And this actually compiles and works as expected, but there are a few things that I'm puzzled about.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My first attempt was with the following method signature:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This did not compile though. Why is that? And how is this declaration different from the other one?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Second, if I try comparing lists with incomparable values at the matching positions, I get a type cast error. For example, when comparing [1,1] to [1,\abc\], I get</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This apparently arises at the type cast in </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>What puzzles me: How is the T resolved to Integer here? In fact, I'm surprised that this actually compiles.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>And third, is there a way to get rid of the unchecked cast? I tried</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>but that did not compile. Why? It seems that somehow it's known that T is meant to be Integer in this iteration, so why can't I type-check against it?</p>&#xA;

How do I get a fixed number of resizing cells with no padding in javafx? <p><strong>Background:</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm working on a visualizer for real-time planning algorithms. The 'world' is provided in a text file, where '_' is a free cell, and '#' is a blocked cell. The following is an example: </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>It is very important that the window has the exact same number of cells in every row and the exact same number of cells in every column. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have to visualize in Kotlin, which is 100% interoperable with Java. I decided to try javafx, version 8.0.60. After doing some research on javafx layouts, I decided TilePane was my best bet. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>What I have so far:</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href=\http://i.stack.imgur.com/4M7Gj.png\ rel=\nofollow\>This</a> is what I have so far. If you look closely, you can see a very small amount of padding within each node of the TilePane. As the robot goes from tile to tile, this small amount of padding introduces a slight error, because the robot moves using the width and height of the <em>tile</em>, not accounting for the padding. This causes the robot to not be in the center of the tile as it traverses the maze.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Additionally, my solution is very dependent on the size of the window. If I adjust it slightly, the world is displayed incorrectly because each row and column do not have the same number of fixed cells.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>These questions are in order of importance. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>Is there a layout or setting that will provide me with a <strong>fixed</strong> number of cells per row and per column? Displaying the world depends on that.</li>&#xA;<li>How do I get rid of the padding between each node in the layout?</li>&#xA;<li>If possible, I would like to resize the layout, while maintaining the first two invariants. Does anyone know of a way to do this?</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Relevant parts of my code:</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Note: robot.fill is the same as calling robot.setFill, and Kotlin omits types and the keyword new when instantiating objects.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;
Any way to inherit from same generic interface twice (with separate types) in Kotlin? <p>I have a scenario in my code where I would like a class to implement an interface for two separate types, like this example:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Kotlin is not pleased with this, citing:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I know that one possible solution is to implement the following code, where I implement the interface with  and then check the types myself and delegate them to their functions.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, that feels like I'm removing type safety and communication about what the class is used for, and is asking for trouble down the line. Is there a better way to implement this in Kotlin? Additionally - what's the reasoning behind it not being allowed the way I indicated in the first sample? Aren't interfaces just a contract of signatures I'm required to implement, or is there something I'm missing involving generics here?</p>&#xA;

I have an interface called <strong>AssetFundCalculator</strong> and a class named <strong>AssetFundCalculatorImpl</strong> which implements the interface.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The <strong>AssetFundValidator</strong> class validates some inputs, and is able to instantiate a valid <strong>AssetFundCalculatorImpl</strong>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'd like if the rest of the program would only know about the interface, and not about the <strong>AssetFundCalculatorImpl</strong>, so that only the <strong>AssetFundValidator</strong> could instantiate it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My package structure is looking like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href=\https://i.stack.imgur.com/DUyAT.jpg\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\><img src=\https://i.stack.imgur.com/DUyAT.jpg\ alt=\enter image description here\></a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In Java, I would give package visibility modifier to the <strong>AssetFundCalculatorImpl</strong> class, or it's constructor, and it would solve the issue, but in Kotlin, there is no package visibility modifier.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there a solution to this? &#xA;I don't want to put this code to a separately compiled module, so the <strong>internal</strong> modifier is not going to work.</p>&#xA;
What is the purpose of `external` keyword in Kotlin? <p>What exactly is the purpose of the <strong></strong> keyword in Kotlin? </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I guess it's for JNI like  in Java, but I can't seem to find any actual reference or documentation on this.</p>&#xA;
How do I manage unit test resources in Kotlin, such as starting/stopping a database connection or an embedded elasticsearch server? <p>In my Kotlin JUnit tests, I want to start/stop embedded servers and use them within my tests.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I tried using the JUnit  annotation on a method in my test class and it works fine, but it isn't the right behaviour since it runs every test case instead of just once.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Therefore I want to use the  annotation on a method, but adding it to a method results in an error saying it must be on a static method.  Kotlin doesn't appear to have static methods.  And then the same applies for static variables, because I need to keep a reference to the embedded server around for use in the test cases.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So how do I create this embedded database just once for all of my test cases?  </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>this question is intentionally written and answered by the author (<a href=\http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/its-ok-to-ask-and-answer-your-own-questions/\>Self-Answered Questions</a>), so that the answers to commonly asked Kotlin topics are present in SO.</em></p>&#xA;
Kotlin `typealias` feature <p>According to the source of <a href=\https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/master/compiler/frontend/src/org/jetbrains/kotlin/lexer/KtTokens.java\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>Kotlin's lexer</a>, there is a  keyword, and it's not \reserved for future use\ like  and .</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also, the <a href=\https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/grammar.html#memberDeclaration\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>grammar reference</a> suggests that  should be a valid keyword for a class member declaration, and when I type  in IntelliJ IDEA (Android Studio) with Kotlin plugin it recognizes it as a keyword but I get <strong><em>expecting member declaration</em></strong> error. I have also tried using it  with the \usual\ syntax, for example like it is implemented in Swift, however with no success.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, is the  feature actually implemented in Kotlin (as of 1.0), and if so, what is the syntax for it?

Kotlin NDArray with a lambda constructor with generic return type <p>I'm trying to create a very simple generic NDArray class in Kotlin that takes a lambda expression as an init function.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>A typical usage would be:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>My problem is that the Kotlin compiler complains on the initialisation of values in the constructor</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>by saying \Cannot use 'T' as reified type parameter.

Kotlin and android lint checks <p>I am really loving to code android apps in Kotlin recently - but I really miss lint. Anyone knows how to get this back ( at least partially ). Is there a project that adapts the android java lint rules to kotlin?

Kotlin: Tail recursion for mutually recursive functions <p>Suppose I write code like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>How do I get Kotlin to optimize these mutually recursive functions, so that I can run  without throwing a StackOverflowError?

kotlin android fragment empty recycler view after back <p>I have this android fragment:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Everything works good except after i come back to this fragment (replaced in fragment manager by another, added to the backstack).

Enforcing a static method compilation inside a subclass with Kotlin? <p>Is there a way I can compile a  method statically inside an existing class in Kotlin? I'm trying to get Gradle to build this as an application with a  method, but I'm having no luck. I've been trying several workarounds too...</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>In my Gradle script, I am trying to specify the  class has a  method. It errors out and can't find the class however when I call . </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I apologize for the confusion but part of my issue might have to do with subclassing and not necessarily finding the  class.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The  function needs access to the  method that is defined in .

Kotlin lazy properties and values reset: a resettable lazy delegate <p>So I use  for android, and when inflating views, I tend to do the following:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This method will work. However, there is a case in which it will bug the app. If this is a fragment, and the fragment goes to the backstack,  will be called again, and the view hierarchy of the fragment will recreated. Which means, the lazy initiated recyclerView will point out to an old view no longer existent. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>A solution is like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And initialise all the properties inside .</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My question is, is there any way to reset lazy properties so they can be initialised again? I like the fact initialisations are all done at the top of a class, helps to keep the code organised.

Unresolved reference: Kotlin needs 2 builds after clean to pick up code when using kapt <p>In our Android app we're using <a href=\https://github.com/Raizlabs/DBFlow\>DBFlow</a> to access the SQLite database. We're referencing the classes generated by DBFlow via Kotlin. We are already aware of the fact that we have the model classes as well as the database class in Java as code generation <a href=\https://github.com/Raizlabs/DBFlow/issues/596\>won't work</a> when writing these classes in Kotlin.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However we still have to build the code twice after every project clean. Executing the first build on a device results in  for seemingly random Kotlin classes (even if they don't access code generated by DBFlow or any of the model classes defined by us). The same is reported already at compile time when enabling Proguard which of course fails the build. The second build always succeeds.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The funny thing is, that code generation already works at the first run - the classes are there and are also picked up by the IDE. But the compiler somehow can't find them making me think that the code generation happens too late in the build process. On the other hand as explained above there are also classes not found which don't have to do anything with code generation and/or annotation processing.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So is there a better solution to this problem than a second build?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For reference, the relevant parts of our app's  looks like this - just like the <a href=\https://github.com/Raizlabs/DBFlow#including-in-your-project\>DBFlow documentation</a> is suggesting:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I found that I also have to rebuild twice for every change I make to the code. It compiles correctly in the first build if I didn't clean before, but the changes simply aren't picked up.</p>&#xA;

package protected alternative in kotlin <p>In java we have package protected (as default) modifier for classes, which allows to have many classes in a single package but expose only few and keep the logic encapsulated.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>With kotlin this seems not to be the case, if i want to have few other classes that shall be visible to each other but not further i have to use private modifier which limits visibility to a single file... so essentially if you had 10 classes in a package and only one of those were public now you'll have one huge file with all the classes in it (and  all over the place)...</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is this normal practice or there is a way to achieve the some similar modularity in kotlin?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I don't understand if they have notion of package why did they get rid of package protected access...</p>&#xA;

Int?)?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>variable coming from a  and I need to detect if it is equal to certain kotlin types (Int, Long, etc). This works with:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>but this only works for non-nullable types, so the first branch does not match to Int?

List containing nullable values to a nullable List in Kotlin <p>I have a  containing null values (which, I suppose, is not forbidden). If one element of this list is null, I want the entire list to be null (what Haskell people call ). The following pseudocode demonstrates what I want to do:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is pseudocode because the compiler complains that .</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What's the idiomatic way to express what I want to in Kotlin? Using Java's  type, this is at least compilable:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But Kotlin has many operators and functionalities regarding null handling, so I thought using null directly would be more idiomatic.</p>&#xA;

How to use Android Support typedef annotations in kotlin? <p>I develop Android applications and often use annotations as compile time parameter checks, mostly android's <a href=\http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/support-annotations\ rel=\noreferrer\>support annotations</a>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Example in java code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I don't want to use enums because of their performance issues in Android.

Kotlin function declaration: equals sign before curly braces <p>In Kotlin, the function declaration syntax allows you to write equals sign before the curly braces. Consider these two examples:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li><p>Without  sign:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The code inside the body gets executed by just calling .</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>With  sign:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here, when  is called, nothing happens, but to get the body executed one can write . </p></li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What is the difference in these two declarations and <strong>why do they behave differently?</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><hr>&#xA;<sup>This question, though having not much meaning, is <a href=\http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/its-ok-to-ask-and-answer-your-own-questions/\>intentionally asked and answered by the author</a>, because a few questions have already been posted where people got problems because of incorrect function definitions.</sup></p>&#xA;
Try monad for kotlin <p>Java 8 didn't provide Try monad. Which is useful for exception handling in functional style.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Is there any ready implementation in kotlin? or shall i implement one?</strong></p>&#xA;
Is there any easy way to see what exceptions a Kotlin function throws? <p>I mostly understand the potential issues with checked exceptions and why Kotlin omits them. However, the issue I am encountering is I can't find any foolproof way of clearly indicating to the caller what exceptions a function may throw. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have run into the issue countless times in Python where my program will crash after running for months because I didn't realise a function from some library I'm using can raise a particular exception. Although being forced to catch exceptions can be quite problematic, it is nice to clearly see all the potential exceptions a function can throw.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So back to the question, is there any simple way to see what exceptions a function throws in Kotlin? What about for methods written in Java that are being called from Kotlin? Even if just in tooling (intelliJ). I'm not counting writing it in javadoc or kdoc as the writer of the function you're using may have omitted it.</p>&#xA;
How to create a property without accessors in Kotlin? <p>I am using a Kotlin class from Java code. My Kotlin class looks like:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I want to be able to access  from Java code like </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>however, I only have  and . Is there any way to make this property directly settable and gettable from Java? Obviously we can't have custom getter and setter in this case.</p>&#xA;
Linking to JVM asm-defined classes from Kotlin using Gradle <p>I have the following setup for an Android app:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The source file in  is <a href=\https://github.com/Storyyeller/Krakatau\ rel=\nofollow\>Krakatau</a> format JVM assembly (it's almost the same as Jasmin). I would like to use the class it defines from my main Kotlin source .</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Before I even get to trying to automate this with Gradle, just assembling the file manually into  doesn't help. Here's what I tried:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>Do a  to get the skeleton  directory (this of course fails with the Kotlin compiler not finding )</li>&#xA;<li><p>I run Krakatau manually to put its class files in  :</p>&#xA;&#xA;</li>&#xA;<li><p>Re-run  with the hope that Kotlin will now find the files; but no improvement whatsoever:</p></li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>So the first question is, obviously, where do I put the resulting  files so that the Kotlin compiler can find them. And the second, follow-up question, is how do I automate that so that a single  command will run the Krakatau assembler first, before running the Kotlin compiler.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For reference, here are my source files:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;
Android Kotlin child onClick blocks parent OnTouch <p>I have this layout hierarchy:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have touch Events for the Parent LinearLayout like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Basically, this will detect a 'Scroll Up' event on the parent, and will perform some animations. The problem is, as soon as I set a click listener for widget1 and widget2, the touch event of the parent is no longer working. Is there any workaround for this?</p>&#xA;
Kotlin override member set and get <p>Does anybody know a better way to listen for member change within own base class?</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>In my opinion JavaRx with Observer would be to much. Kotlin Delegate does not work with inheritance (or i could not find a way yet). The best i came up with is to override setter and getter of \t\ in \BOO\. But this is a little bit awkward because of this \Why should i overwrite a member?\ or \Why do i have to define set and get when i just need set?\</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So my solution so far:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;

Kotlin class equality fails <p>The following snippet shows the result of testing equality of Kotlin  references obtained from different sources. Their string representations are the same.

If it's not a bug what is the reliable way to test equality of es?</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<p>EDIT:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The workaround is to use  method. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The docs says:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I.e.  is true</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But it doesn't justifies why es having same string representation are different. At least it's confusing. And it's good idea to note about that in docs.</p>&#xA;

Elementary functions in kotlin <p>Looking for a way to get elementary functions and their derivatives I approach it like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there a more idiomatic way to do it in Kotlin?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have exposed the problem as I had done in Java, that is, classes that contain functions. My question is if I can do the same with functions, pass them on to a class like:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;
Function definition: fun vs val <p>I'm curious about what is the suggested way to define member functions in Kotlin. Consider these two member functions:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>These appear to accomplish the same thing, but I found subtle differences.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The  based definition, for instance, seems to be more flexible in some scenarios. That is, I could not work out a straight forward way to compose  with other functions, but I could with . To toy around with these definitions, I used the <a href=\https://github.com/MarioAriasC/funKTionale\>funKTionale</a> library. I found that this does not compile:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But if  were defined as a  pointing to the same function, it would compile just fine. To figure out what was going on I asked IntelliJ to explicitly define the type of  and  for me, and it gives me this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>So one is of type , the other is of type . It's easy to see that both represent functions of type .</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What is the difference between these two types, and in which cases does it matter? I noticed that for top-level functions, I can compose them fine using either definition, but in order to make the aforementioned composition compile, I had to write it like so:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>i.e. I had to partially apply it to  first.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Since I don't have to go through this hassle when using s for functions, is there a reason why I should ever define non-Unit member functions using ? Is there a difference in performance or semantics that I am missing?</p>&#xA;

How to implement Builder pattern in Kotlin? <p>Hi I am a newbie in the Kotlin world. I like what I see so far and started to think to convert some of our libraries we use in our application from Java to Kotlin.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>These libraries are full of Pojos with setters, getters and Builder classes. Now I have googled to find what is the best way to implement Builders in Kotlin but no success.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>2nd Update: The question is how to write a Builder design-pattern for a simple pojo with some parameters in Kotlin? The code below is my attempt by writing java code and then using the eclipse-kotlin-plugin to convert to Kotlin.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;

IntelliJ's IdeaVim plugin disables converting Java to Kotlin <p>I would like to use IntelliJ's feature, which converts Java code to Kotlin by simply copy-pasting from Java file to Kotlin file. It is working fine, but when I turn on IdeaVim plugin, it refuses to work anymore. I know Vim decently and I that's not the problem with my misunderstanding Vim edit modes.

How to organize Kotlin extension methods <p>Let's say I have a few extension methods for \MyClass\.&#xA;My question is, what's the best practice to organize/store these methods?&#xA;Should they be simply put into a \MyClassExtensions\ Kotlin file?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have tried to encapsulate these methods within a class, but after importing the class I couldn't seem to figure out how to use/access the extension methods.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Edit:&#xA;For clarification, I was not asking for help what to call a file that contains extension methods. I was asking about best practices/approaches to store/organize such methods. Ie. should they be simply put into kotlin files, or should they be encapsulated in a class.

kotlin infinite sequences with iterator function <p>I am confused about how to create an infinite sequence in kotlin to use for lazy evaluation. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In java:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>but sequences seem much more confusing then java streams. The sequence constructor is very confusing the doc for it says:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>but I don't know what it means by an iterator function or how to make one.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have this which compiles but obviously doesn't print anything. I don't think my iterator function makes any sense. It wants a function that takes no arguments and returns an iterator, which isn't like the java .iterate function at all. iterator happens to have a constructor that takes an array, which would make sense if I had a data set to work with in an array but I don't. I want to be working with an infinite sequence. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>There is no .limit, so I previously tried to add a .reduce but the arguments for .reduce were even more confusing. I think there should be a .toList but I knew it wasn't working so I didn't try it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If someone would show me how to implement the above java code in lotlin it would help a lot.</p>&#xA;

Type signature for Kotlin function with default parameters <p>Let's say I have:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I get an error since ::add has two parameters, but the signature of addInvoker requires it to have zero parameters.

Escape reserved words in an import <p>When using Java classes in Kotlin, sometimes they use identifiers that are reserved word in kotlin. The java interop documentation says you can use backtick (`) character but this doesn't work in imports. So how to escaped reserved words on import.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>e.g. The tinkerpop library has a class called '__' but thats a Kotlin reserved so if I import it like below it gives an error.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I can import it using the wild card like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>but because I only use the one class then Intellij's code formatter replaces it with the previous version of the import that gives an error. (Which I guess is a bug in the intellij formatter as well)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For the answers that suggest using backtick ` works. It does not. This does not compile even on try.kotlinlang.org.&#xA;Assuming a class exists defined as</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is what happens when you import it with backticks.&#xA;<a href=\https://i.stack.imgur.com/a4jkA.png\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\><img src=\https://i.stack.imgur.com/a4jkA.png\ alt=\Escapingdoesnotcompile\></a></p>&#xA;
How to return result in doInBackground after login API completion block is finished in UserLoginTask <p>I used default LoginActivity in Android Studio and created a simple login view. In my app, the authentication task and access token generation is done by the server via API call. However, since the api call must have a completion block, my login function in  also does. Therefore the authentication result exists in the thread of the completion block, which makes the returned result of the original  to  incorrect. The functions are overriden, so I cannot change their parameters and formats. I'm still new in android developing and still not very familiar with its asynchronized task, so I would like to ask if there is any way to halt in  and wait for the result in the completion block? Or is there any better solution to solve my API login? Thanks.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here the code of my UserLoginTask (written in kotlin but I think the concept would be the same with java):</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;

How can I override a java method, and change the nullability of a parameter? <p>I'm overriding a method from a Java library, and the parameter for the function is annotated as . However, when the method is called, the parameter frequently comes in with a  value. When I override the method in Kotlin, it forces me to respect the  annotation and mark the parameter as not nullable. Of course, Kotlin throws an exception at run time when the parameter comes in with a null value. Is there some way I can override the method in Kotlin and ignore the  annotation?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Specifically, I'm using the appcompat library for Android. The method is in AppCompatActivity.java</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The override in Kotlin:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;

Does Kotlin custom get execute method call <p>To increase the readability of calls to SharedPreferences.Editor I want to use a Kotlin variable that will execute 'getSharedPreferences.edit()' each time I need a new SharedPreferences.Editor. Initially I was going to use something like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But then I was informed that 'editPreferences' will hold the reference to the same editor when what I really want it to create a new editor each time the 'editPreferences' is called.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If a custom getter was used would a new editor be returned each time? Something like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Still getting up and running with Kotlin and am not sure if the get() method would hold reference to the editor instead of creating a new one. </p>&#xA;

Kotlin lazy block not executed when using Mockito and InjectMocks <p>I'm using Mockito to test my Kotlin code.  It's a web app and I use spring to inject values into some fields.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example, my class snippet looks something like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>To mimic this in my unit test I use the  and  annotations from Mockito.  So my test looks something like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Which all works fine.  However, I also have a lazy initialization block in my component like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>When my test calls  I would expect  to be called as it initializes  but this doesn't happen.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If I put a breakpoint in the lazy block, it's never hit.  Now I am assuming this is something to do with the way Mockito and  must 'touch'  but I don't really know.  If I construct  manually then the lazy block is executed - but this won't inject my mocks.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How can I ensure the lazy block is called correctly from my test?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:  After a week absence, attempting to reproduce this without any changes and I could not.  Can't explain it.</p>&#xA;

Kotlin: onGlobalLayout not being called <p>I'm using Kotlin, and using onGlobalLayout to load an image view. through loadUrl. Without using afterMeasured, my image is loaded well, but at times due to the height is 0, it crashes.

What could be wrong with my code?</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Perhaps this is not Kotlin specific, but more to invoking onGlobalLayout is not done correctly on my side?</p>&#xA;

Running Kotlin HTML Builder in the Browser <p>I am a Java developer that is very new to Kotlin. I love the language though, and I like how easily web applications can be done with it. The problem is that I cannot figure out how to run Kotlin HTML builder files in the browser, so that I can create a basic web page skeleton in kotlin. I can output it in the IDE, but it is silly how hard it seems to be to get it to run in my browser. This may be a dumb question and I'm missing something very obvious, but I can't seem to find the answer online. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Keep in mind that I'm not using the Intelli-J IDE. Would love to, but can't afford to pay out the nose just to do web development in Kotlin. Been using Eclipse. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks in advance.</p>&#xA;
Kotlin Web Programming without Using Intelli-J Ultimate? <p>I am a Java developer who has fallen in love with Kotlin.I am very new to it, but it is a Great language. I just have one problem: I also love web development. It makes it very difficult to do web development in Kotlin since every tutorial out there is in Intelli-J Ultimate Edition and I just can't swallow the cost right now. There is already not quite as much support for Kotlin online, being such a new language. Are there alternative IDE's and/or ways to use Intelli-J CE to develop Web Apps (JSP-like, Kara, HML builder) with Kotlin? The cost of Intelli-J Ultimate is forcing me to do all of my development in Intelli-J except Kotlin web development, which is annoying. And I cannot seem to find any really good alternative anyway.</p>&#xA;

Disable incremental build for kapt <p>Since android gradle plugin has enabled incremental build by default annotation processing breaks, because only those classes who has been changed since last incremental build will be taken into account from annotation processors.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So for java source code we usually use  grald plugin to run annotation processing.

How to do PATCH properly in strongly typed languages based on Spring - example <p>According to my knowledge:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li> - update object with its whole representation (replace)</li>&#xA;<li> - update object with given fields only (update)</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm using Spring to implement a pretty simple HTTP server. When a user wants to update his data he needs to make a HTTP  to some endpoint (let's say: ). His request body is mapped to a DTO via , which looks like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Then I use an object of this class to update (patch) the user object:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>My doubt is: what if a client (web app for example) would like to clear a property? I would ignore such a change. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>How can I know, if a user wanted to clear a property (he sent me null intentionally) or he just doesn't want to change it? It will be null in my object in both cases.</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I can see two options here:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Agree with the client that if he wants to remove a property he should send me an empty string (but what about dates and other non-string types?)</li>&#xA;<li>Stop using DTO mapping and use a simple map, which will let me check if a field was given empty or not given at all. What about request body validation then? I use  right now.</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How should such cases should be properly handled, in harmony with REST and all good practices?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>One could say that  shouldn't be used in such an example and I should use  to update my User. But then what about API updates (adding a new property for example)? I would have to version my API (or version user endpoint alone); after every User change, , which accepts  with an old request body,  which accepts  with a new request body, etc. I guess it's not the solution and  exists for a reason.</p>&#xA;

Kotlin classes that do not use extensions are built correctly all the time. &#xA;This leads to a NoClassDefFoundError whenever I run the program (on subsequent builds, the first one runs without issues).&#xA;I have tried everything and I am starting to get a bit desperate…&#xA;Here is my build.gradle for the whole project:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here is build.gradle for the module that I am attempting to use kotlin in</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>buildscript {&#xA;    repositories {&#xA;        jcenter()&#xA;        mavenCentral()&#xA;        maven {&#xA;            url 'http://repo.spring.io/milestone'&#xA;        }&#xA;        maven {&#xA;            url \http://repo.bodar.com/\&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    dependencies {&#xA;        classpath 'com.jakewharton.hugo:hugo-plugin:1.2.1'&#xA;        classpath 'me.tatarka:gradle-retrolambda:3.2.4'&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;apply plugin: 'com.android.application'&#xA;apply plugin: 'com.jakewharton.hugo'&#xA;apply plugin: 'me.tatarka.retrolambda'&#xA;apply plugin: 'groovyx.grooid.groovy-android'&#xA;apply plugin: 'kotlin-android'&#xA;apply plugin: 'kotlin-android-extensions'&#xA;&#xA;android {&#xA;    compileSdkVersion 23&#xA;    buildToolsVersion \23.0.2\&#xA;    productFlavors {&#xA;        dev {&#xA;            minSdkVersion 21&#xA;        }&#xA;        prod {&#xA;            minSdkVersion 19&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    sourceSets {&#xA;        main.java.srcDirs += 'src/main/kotlin'&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    lintOptions {&#xA;        disable 'InvalidPackage'&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    packagingOptions {&#xA;        exclude 'META-INF/LICENSE.txt'&#xA;        exclude 'META-INF/license.txt'&#xA;        exclude 'META-INF/NOTICE.txt'&#xA;        exclude 'META-INF/notice.txt'&#xA;        exclude 'META-INF/services/javax.annotation.processing.Processor'&#xA;        exclude 'META-INF/services/org.codehaus.groovy.transform.ASTTransformation'&#xA;        exclude 'LICENSE.txt'&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    compileOptions {&#xA;        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8&#xA;        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    defaultConfig {&#xA;        applicationId \com.example.name\&#xA;        minSdkVersion 16&#xA;        targetSdkVersion 23&#xA;        multiDexEnabled true&#xA;        vectorDrawables.useSupportLibrary = true&#xA;&#xA;        testInstrumentationRunner \android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner\&#xA;        resValue \string\, \tray__authority\, \${applicationId}.tray\&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    dexOptions {&#xA;        javaMaxHeapSize \4g\&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    retrolambda {&#xA;        jvmArgs '-noverify'&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    buildTypes {&#xA;        release {&#xA;            minifyEnabled false&#xA;            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'&#xA;        }&#xA;        debug {&#xA;            testCoverageEnabled = true&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;kapt {&#xA;    generateStubs = true&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;repositories {&#xA;    jcenter()&#xA;    mavenCentral()&#xA;    maven {&#xA;        url \http://repo.bodar.com/\&#xA;    }&#xA;    maven {&#xA;        url \https://clojars.org/repo/\&#xA;    }&#xA;    maven { url \http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/\ }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;dependencies {&#xA;    compile \org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:$kotlin_version\&#xA;    compile \org.jetbrains.anko:anko-common:$anko_version\&#xA;    androidTestCompile 'org.codehaus.groovy:groovy:2.4.2:grooid'&#xA;    androidTestCompile 'com.andrewreitz:spock-android:1.2.2'&#xA;    androidTestCompile 'com.android.support.test:testing-support-lib:0.1'&#xA;    androidTestCompile('org.spockframework:spock-core:1.0-groovy-2.4') {&#xA;        exclude group: 'org.codehaus.groovy'&#xA;        exclude group: 'junit'&#xA;    }&#xA;    // Optional, needed for mocking&#xA;    androidTestCompile 'com.google.de

Kotlin delegation to expression instead of fixed reference <p>Suppose I have a very intricate specification defined as an interface:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And a standard implementation:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now suppose that I want to create a class that implements this specification and delegates to an implementation, but the exact delegate object is mutable throughout the object's lifetime. Here's an example:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The problem with the above example is that the constructor argument  is set as the delegate object when the constructor is called. The delegate is then accessed by the class directly instead of performing a property access. (This has been confirmed by looking through the bytecode produced by Kotlin.)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, even if the property  is modified after the class is constructed, the delegate does not change.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Can anybody provide a method for performing this delegation in Kotlin without having to write out every single method?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>An ideal solution would also allow for delegation to something as general as a lambda or other expression that would be evaluated and used as the delegate whenever the delegate is needed throughout the lifetime of the object.</p>&#xA;

Unresolved reference KClass trying to use DBFlow and Kotlin with Android <p>I'm using kotlin 1.0.1-2 in my Android project. I want to use DBFlow as my ORM.

Why does context not have the activity's primary color attribute? <p>I'm writing a library that has an activity for photo editing. When the user is done editing, there is a \done\ button with a color background. I want to be able to customize the color of the button so I have static methods in a <em>different class</em> that create drawables with different colors. Something that I want to do in this class is a function that receives a  reference and creates a drawable with the primary color. Here's my code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This function gets the primary color from the  and returns a drawable with that color. The problem is that the primaryColor attribute is not found, so it returns a colorless drawable.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What's even weirder is that if instead I fetch the primary color in my activity and <em>then</em> call the static method, it works. Here's the code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>So the real question is: <strong>Why does  fail when called from my static method using the activity's context reference, but it succeeds when called from the activity?</strong></p>&#xA;

How can I more easily use Jooq transactions in Kotlin <p>I have Jooq code written in Kotlin using transactions, and sometimes I want a method to work stand-alone as a top-level action that will have its own transactions, and other times want it to work composited with other methods within the same transaction.  For example, I have two lower level functions  and  that I want to compose into different higher level data methods and inherit their transaction if present, otherwise have their own.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I know in Spring or other frameworks there are annotations that can be added that validate \transaction required\ or \create transaction if none\ type functionality.  But how do I do the same with Jooq + Kotlin without using those libraries?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The closest I came up with is to pass the transaction in as an optional parameter and default it to a new transaction if missing.

Dagger 2 error: dependency “cannot be provided without an @Inject constructor” <p>I'm trying to use Dagger 2 in my Android project. For starters, I want to make use of two components responsible for injecting application-wide and activity-wide dependencies respectively. As a basic reference, among other things I used <a href=\https://stackoverflow.com/a/32227842/1815052\>this answer</a>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So there are two different ways of setting relationship between components: with the  annotation and with the  parameter.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>If I go with the first one, my  works fine.

API call not working inside Anko Async <p>I'm trying to make an http request in Android, using Kotlin, and I've come across two ways of doing so.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>One is the traditional way, using  (not really pretty) which I got to work with the following code (just the , as the rest of the class seemed unnecessary): </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now, I've come across a library called Anko, which many here know, and I tried to use its DSL for asynchronous tasks. The thing is, I haven't found a lot of info here about Anko for asynchronous tasks, so I thought I would open a new topic to see if someone could walk me through what I'm doing wrong, or what they think I should do to make it work.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The code I wanted to use is the following:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I tried to keep it as slim as possible so to minimize any potential mistakes, but I must be doing something wrong here because the code inside the async block is not doing anything, yet the app is not crashing and I'm not getting any exceptions. I've tried debugging it using Intellij IDEA, but after the first line inside the async block it stops the debugging while saying \The application is running\. My best guess is that it got hung up somewhere in that first line due to the failed connection, but I don't know.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I've also tried to use the regular  inside the async block, but that hasn't worked either.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Anyway, any help would be deeply appreciated.</p>&#xA;

Skip if empty in Kotlin Maven plug-in <p>We have enabled the Kotlin Maven plug-in in our top-most project POM, like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>ATM, only a handful of the modules in this project have Kotlin source code. (The project is around 50 modules.) The idea is that most will eventually have Kotlin code, and we don't want to have to wire things up on a per project basis. We want to configure it once, and forget about it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This works except that we get this warning in the build for most modules:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>We had this problem with the JAR plug-in as well. That plug-in has a configuration option that allows us to do like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This shutup that plug-in's similar warnings. The Kotlin compiler plug-in doesn't seem to have any such config option though.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, my questions are:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>Is there such a configuration option that we're overlooking?</li>&#xA;<li>Should we configure the Kotlin compiler plug-in differently to avoid this warning?</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>TIA!</p>&#xA;

Single Kotlin+libgdx codebase deployed to Android, desktop and browser? <p>Is this possible? I'm thinking that deploying to both Android and desktop shouldn't be too hard (since Java can already do it). I learned that Kotlin can also be transpiled to JavaScript. Does this mean that I can deploy the <strong>same codebase</strong> to all three targets, or will I need different code for the browser?

Which is the preferred syntax when using annotation-based dependency injection in Kotlin? <p>We're using an existing framework which - among other things - provides dependency injection through annotations. In Java, to inject field value we would do something like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Since reflection allows to reassign fields that are normally final, this also a valid declaration:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>To make the declaration even shorter (and also make the fields available in unit test classes, while keeping them a part of semi-private API), you could do it like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>When it comes to Kotlin, we're stuck with this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Nullable type approach requires additional null check (or  operator) on every service use, even though we're 100% sure they will never be null - unless something went completely wrong, in which case we have bigger problems.</li>&#xA;<li> approach seems to perform unnecessary checks at runtime (which are, well, highly unlikely to become performance bottlenecks, but still) and is rather verbose.</li>&#xA;<li>Both approaches allow to reassign the variable to another value. We're yet to find a way of replacing  with  without overriding getter or using a back-up field, which faces the same problem. Ironically, they are both longer than Java declarations in many cases.</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So - what is the preferred way of declaring annotated Kotlin fields, which will be injected automatically and we're 100% sure that they will never be null?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>While I understand that there are multiple frameworks with Kotlin-friendly syntax solving similar problems (like <a href=\https://github.com/kohesive/injekt\ rel=\nofollow\>Injekt</a>), I'm asking if there's a nicer way of doing it with what we have.</p>&#xA;

RxJava- Turn Observable into Iterator, Stream, or Sequence <p>I know this breaks a lot of Rx rules, but I really like <a href=\https://github.com/davidmoten/rxjava-jdbc\ rel=\nofollow\>RxJava-JDBC</a> and so do my teammates. Relational databases are very core to what we do and so is Rx.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However there are some occasions where we do not want to emit as an  but would rather just have a pull-based Java 8  or Kotlin . But we are very accustomed to the RxJava-JDBC library which only returns an . </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Therefore, I am wondering if there is a way I can turn an  into a  using an extension function, and not do any intermediary collection or  calls. Below is all I have so far but my head is spinning now trying to connect push and pull based systems, and I cannot buffer either as the  is stateful with each  call. Is this an impossible task?</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;
Kotlin fails to inline some bodies <p>I have an inline function which accepts two lambdas. This function is called in a hotspot of my code and, despite it being inline, thousands of objects are created for the bodies.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What's interesting is commenting out, or replacing the bodies with simple calls like s and everything works perfectly. But for some reason with my specific use, it seems like inline is failing to do its job!</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How can I resolve this? And what are the limitations associated with inlining bodies? Is this a bug?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href=\https://i.imgur.com/bJsz4Cx.png\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\><img src=\https://i.imgur.com/bJsz4Cx.png\ alt=\enter image description here\></a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My use case:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The method header:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;
kotlin project can't be build in gradle <p>I have a java project that write in kotlin ,i use intelliJ IDEA to develop this project.  I have trouble on the dependencies setting (multiple project). I already read lot of examples , but I can't find the workaround , here is my dependencies setting code,&#xA;it can be build in java class correctly , but the kotlin class will get lot of error 'Unresolved reference' . Is that any wrong about my setting or gradle is not suitable with kotlin . </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>PS : when i only build core project , build process will successful , but build at test project will get the reference unresolved error   </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>setting.gradle</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;
\can't find referenced class\ with Proguard and Kotlin <p>I am having a strange problem with proguard and kotlin. I am gradually converting a proguarded project to kotlin - which went very fine so far but I am getting proguard errors when converting certain classes. I could not yet isolate what the special property of these classes is so it breaks - they seems to be no different than the other ones. As an example InputStreamWithSource is just:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>and it completely works in the IDE - I can deploy to a device - also all UI tests are running fine. Just when trying to assembleRelease the project I am getting proguard errors I do not understand:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>when I add a dontwarn for these classes in the proguard configuration than it crashes at runtime - so these classes are really removed - but they should not be removed as they are used.</p>&#
Null Pointer Exception In Spring Proxy Class and Kotlin <p>I am facing some problems with kotlin in conjunction with spring. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have a controller bean (without an interface btw) which has an auto-wired service bean via the primary constructor.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It works perfectly unless I use caching annotations for the controller. Apparently springs caching generates a proxy class under the hood which deals with the caching.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My code looks like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The problem now is a null pointer exception when the method is executed, actually  is  which technically is not possible as it is a nonnull variable in kotlin.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I assume that <a href=\https://spring.io/blog/2012/05/23/transactions-caching-and-aop-understanding-proxy-usage-in-spring\ rel=\nofollow\>class proxies generated by spring</a> initialize the class with null values instead of the autowired bean. This must be a common pitfall using kotlin and spring. How did you circumvent this problem?</p>&#xA;
Proto3 setting value equal to default is not recognised in runtime <p> is not as strict as , and there are no  or  fields, there are no custom  values.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Given the following definition...</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>There are default values for any of those fields, after all now there are no rules of what you must or must not provide before you  your object.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So the default for  is ,  is  and  is , if you print an instance where you did not provide one of the fields <strong>or provided the default value</strong> then runtime will treat it as it was never provided in both cases, so its not possible to determine if the value was manually set to  or it was taken as the default.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example if we execute the following code (its kotlin) </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>we will have this output</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>at the very least this is annoying as when you print your proto objects using standard  or json printer you'll have this cropped output...</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But what if your client does not necessarily care about default values and expects all fields to be present?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Question : is there a way to change this behaviour? at the very least how do we ensure that if value was set it is being shown?</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Maybe there is a way to tell  to generate different code (affecting defaults behaviour)...</p>&#xA;
Product Flavor: Duplicate class found <p>I have a very stupid question, but I'm sitting here in front of my app since hours but I can't understand what the problem is.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have an android app (written in kotlin) and I want to make two product flavors and override a class / file in the product flavor:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So my gradle script is that:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>My files are structured as follows:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>So basically I would like to override  file in  product flavor, but somehow it doesn't work: It says class Bar is duplicated. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Any hint?</p>&#xA;
Unacceptable Performance Reading Transparent .png Pixel by Pixel <p>I'm creating a tool that detects sprites in a sprite sheet and converts each found sprite into a new BufferedImage.

Method not being called, no error, maybe has to do with generics/companion objects/inheritance/concurrency/inlining <p>Okay, so I have a class called ChannelBase which is the superclass for all channel-type things in Slack (basically just Channels and Groups as MPIMs aren't considered groups anymore)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Within ChannelBase there is an  (the generic is the type of the subclass, aka  or ). The subclass then has its companion object extend ChannelCompanion, which forces it to have a  function, and provides the companion object with a  that gathers the channel list from the Slack API and parses it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So basically here's what we have, let's assume we're registering the  class.&#xA;When  (inherited from ChannelCompanion) is called, here is what should happen:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>-> Call <br>&#xA;-> Asynchronously make HTTP request to a slack team's channels.list method<br>&#xA;-> Parse the JSON and retrieve the array of Channel JsonObjects<br>&#xA;-> Parse each JsonObject into a Channel object using   (an abstract fun in ChannelCompanion)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The problem is that when  gets called, the Thread freezes. There is no error or exception, it just freezes. If you don't understand the structure of this (it's hard to explain), here is the repository: <a href=\https://github.com/Deanveloper/SlaK/tree/master/src/main/kotlin/com/deanveloper/slak/channel\ rel=\nofollow\>https://github.com/Deanveloper/SlaK/tree/master/src/main/kotlin/com/deanveloper/slak/channel</a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Debug code shows that the program freezes when  is called. The first line of  is to print that the function was run, and it doesn't print. The line before it gets called is printed, though. Not quite sure what's going on here.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It is good to note that while there are multiple threads, this is all executed in the same thread after the HTTP request is made.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If you want to clone the repository and test for yourself, <a href=\https://github.com/Deanveloper/SlaK\ rel=\nofollow\>https://github.com/Deanveloper/SlaK</a>. In the JUnit test directory, go to BaseTest and replace the encrypted API key with an API key for a Slack team of your own</p>&#xA;

I've read through the docs but I may be missing something (a lot). Feel free to just point at the right direction</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>EDIT: Adding compilable example</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;
How can I pause an event from flowing through an observable? <p>I am trying to create an Observable that can be paused in such a way that items stop being pushed through the observable until it becomes unpaused.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>At which point, I'd like it to resume processing all of the unprocessed items.  My data source comes from outside the class, so what I have winds up looking like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>What I'm aiming for is that the  function would stop the events from even going to the server (but would hold on to them until an eventual ).  At the point  happens, we'd send the events.  (Obviously we'd add in some extra help for back pressure in case we had <em>too many</em> events during the paused state.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I've tried various uses of buffering and windowing in order to make this work, but it never actually <em>pauses</em> the observable.  Instead, one of two things happens:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>The event is dropped entirely (in the case of an unsubscribe, filter, etc.)</li>&#xA;<li>The event flows through as though nothing has happened.</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there anything I can do to support this use case?  Or should I be writing this under the expectation that one of the above two outcomes is what will happen?</p>&#xA;

In Kotlin, how to delegate to an interface and provide only a no-arg public constructor? <p>The problem arises from the fact that Kotlin <a href=\https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/delegation.html#class-delegation\ rel=\nofollow\ title=\class delegation\>class delegation</a> allows to delegate only to constructor parameters, thus seemingly forcing you to provide constructor with an argument.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Below is my original question pertaining to concrete use case of this problem.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I want to do the following:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>where </p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li> inherits from <a href=\https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/NewCollectionTypesExplained#table\ rel=\nofollow\>ImmutableTable</a> (<a href=\http://google.github.io/guava/releases/snapshot/api/docs/src-html/com/google/common/collect/ImmutableTable.html#line.45\ rel=\nofollow\>src</a>) or at least <a href=\https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/NewCollectionTypesExplained#table\ rel=\nofollow\>Table</a> </li>&#xA;<li>and I do not have to manually delegate all the  methods to some base implementation.</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I also want to avoid the following:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>i.e. I do not want to be forced to use companion objects / static factory methods. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I tried to extend , but I am getting .</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I tried to extend  interface and delegate to it (to avoid reimplementing methods) but then I am forced to provide an instance of  as constructor parameter.

What is the difference between \const\ and \val\? <p>I have recently read about the  keyword, and I'm so confused! I can't find any difference between it and the  keyword, I mean we can use both of them to make a immutable variable, is there anything else that I'm missing?</p>&#xA;
Array/List iteration without extra object allocations <p>I'm working on a game written in Kotlin and was looking into improving GC churn. One of the major sources of churn are for-loops called in the main game/rendering loops that result in the allocation of iterators.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Turning to the documentation, I found this paragraph:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href=\https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/control-flow.html#for-loops\ rel=\noreferrer\>https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/control-flow.html#for-loops</a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is this really true? To verify, I took this simple Kotlin program and inspected the generated byte code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>According to the quote above, this should not result in any objects allocated, but get compiled down to a good old pre-Java-5 style for-loop. However, what I got was this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This looks to me as if a method called  is called that allocates a temporary  object to back up bounds checking in this loop. How is this an \optimal implementation\ with \no extra objects created\, or am I missing something?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>&#xA;So, after toying around a bit more and looking at the answers, the following appears to be true for Kotlin 1.0.2:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Arrays:</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>: range allocation</li>&#xA;<li>: no allocation</li>&#xA;<li>: no allocation</li>&#xA;<li>: no allocation</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Collections:</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li> range allocation</li>&#xA;<li>: no allocation</li>&#xA;<li>: iterator allocation</li>&#xA;<li>: iterator allocation</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;

Kotlin maven plugin order of compilation <p>I have a question regarding the kotlin-maven plugin: &#xA;How is the order of compilation determined? &#xA;I mean: Must the kotlin compiler come first?

Kotlin with JPA/Hibernate: no lazy-loading without `open`? <p>Most Kotlin JPA example code looks like this</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>or even</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now, the <a href=\https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.1/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#entity-pojo\ rel=\nofollow\>Hibernate User Guide</a>, and I think also several other ORMs, state that they usually want to create proxies or otherwise extend the model class, but to allow that in Kotlin the class has to be explicitly defined . This is currently impossible with data classes and I assume, judging from my own experience, that most people don't think about it when writing JPA entities in Kotlin.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, to come to my question (this is stackoverflow after all), is it enough to do</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>or would we actually have to do</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>to not needlessly hinder the ORM at doing its job properly?<br>&#xA;If it really is harmful, we should probably propose to add a warning to IntelliJ IDEA, that if a class is has an  annotation, it should be defined .</p>&#xA;
Tokenizing a string in Kotlin <p>I have a sql query string to create or replace a trigger for an Oracle DB that looks like this...</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm trying to remove all of the SQL keywords so that I am left with a map looking something like...</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm trying right now to use a regular expression to remove all of the keywords and then I'll be able to split the remaining string up accordingly. My replace looks like this...</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Where s is the string that I gave above. When I run this, there is no change in the output. I'm not very good at regex (I very rarely use it), so it wouldn't be a shock to hear that mine is absolutely wrong. I'm also very new to Kotlin, so if there is a more idiomatic way to do this (which I'm sure there is) I would be very excited to learn!</p>&#xA;
How to properly override a method returning an instance of generic class in Kotlin <p>I have an abstract generic class:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And I have a subclass of it: </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also I have a class with a protected abstract method:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And I have it overridden in a subclass:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Android Studio highlights the overridden function cast saying \This cast never succeed\.

Jacoco coverage and Kotlin default parameters <p>I am having the following constructor:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now when measuring coverage I always get misses for when defaults are used.

How do I initialize a final field in Kotlin? <p>Let's say I declared a final field with  (Java) or  (Kotlin). During initialization I want to initialize the field with the result of a call to a remote service. In Java I would be able to initialize it in the constructor (e.g. ), but in Kotlin I can't figure out how to do that because as far as I can tell the field has to be initialized in the same line it's declared. What's the solution here?</p>&#xA;
Effective Enums in Kotlin with reverse lookup? <p>I'm trying to find the best way to do a 'reverse lookup' on an enum in Kotlin. One of my takeaways from Effective Java was that you introduce a static map inside the enum to handle the reverse lookup. Porting this over to Kotlin with a simple enum leads me to code that looks like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>My question is, is this the best way to do this, or is there a better way? What if I have several enums that follow a similar pattern? Is there a way in Kotlin to make this code more re-usable across enums?</p>&#xA;

jvm comparing String with StringBuffer.reverse() always fails <p>I had a problem where I was to find all he substrings of a string that are palindromes. Input would always be 1 word. The test input was aabaa. I decided to try be clever and make a string buffer of my substring then use the reverse method to compare with the original using String.equals. It didn't work.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>When I uncomment the first print statement the output look like this using test input aabaa</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>So I am getting the correct substrings, but the last if statement never resolves true and I don't know why this is.</p>&#xA;

How to turn a Mutable Collection into an Immutable one <p>I was writing a small piece of code in which I internally handle my data in a mutable map, which in turn has mutable lists.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I wanted to expose my data to the API user, but to avoid any unsafe publication of my data I wanted to expose it in immutable collections even when internally being handled by mutable ones.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I managed to expose only  and  (which are immutable) in the public API of my class, but the instances I am actually exposing are <em>still</em> inherently mutable.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Which means an API user could simply cast my returned map as an ImmutableMap and gain access to the precious private data internal to my class, which was intended to be protected of this kind of access.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I couldn't find a copy constructor in the collection factory methods  or  and so I was wondering what is the best and most efficient way to turn a mutable collection into an immutable one.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Any advice or recommendations?</p>&#xA;

Kotlin: Modifying (immutable) List through cast, is it legitimate? <p>As we know the List in Kotlin is immutable i.e. you can't do add and remove as below.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But if we cast it to ArrayList as below, the add and remove works.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I just thought this is odd, as myList is really a List, which is suppose to be immutable.

What is the best way to handle null situations in Kotlin when extending a Java class? <p>I'm really stuck with situation when something can be null in Kotlin. When a value cannot be null - it is clear. But how to handle situation when something can be null by default. Take a look at this example:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>So I should handle that situation this way:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But what if map is <strong>null</strong>. What should I do in this case? I've faced this problem while using java. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Ok, in java, if map is null, we will get NPE.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>And for me NPE is better than nothing. The program crashes and this is a signal for me, that something is wrong and I should fix it. In this way, I can't even trace my problem and why it is happen. &#xA;Yeah, we can write something like:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>and there is some meaning in this code, yes. &#xA;But there is still some hesitation in me head about the whole null safety thing.&#xA;Safe calls for example is weird thing which produces null and (In my opinion) heisenbugs or bugs that are hard to catch. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Can someone explain to me what is going on here, and what are the best practices to use null-safety. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><em>I'm pretty sure that this thing is useful, because I'm not as smart as guys in JB</em></p>&#xA;

Kotlin Anonymous Function Parameter Unit Testing <p>As per <a href=\https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37655431/kotlin-unit-testing-for-function-parameter-and-object\>Kotlin Unit Testing for Function Parameter and Object</a>, we could test the function variable , as it is an object function variable.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However if code is written using anonymous/inlining function parameter (which is a very nice Kotlin feature, that allow us to eliminate unnecessary temp variable for it)...</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>How to write my unit test that test this part of code?</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Or the inlining of the function parameter (as above) is something not good for unit testing, and hence should be avoided?</p>&#xA;

Benefits of LINQ over functional method chaines <p>There was a discussion on Kotlin Slack about a possibility of adding code trees to support things like C# LINQ.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In C# LINQ has many applications, but I want to focus on only one (because others a already presumably covered by Kotlin syntax): composing SQL queries to remote databases.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Prerequisites: </p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li><p>We have a data schema of an SQL database expressed somehow in the code so that static tools (or the type system) could check the correctness (at least the naming) of an SQL query </p></li>&#xA;<li><p>We have to generate the queries as strings</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>We want a syntax close to SQL or Java streams </p></li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Question</strong>: what do expression trees add to the syntax that is so crucial for the task at hand? How good an SQL builder can be without them?</p>&#xA;
Get class reference from top level function in kotlin <p>I wrote a short program which does not require any classes and in turn consits of top level functions only.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>To find your jar's location from java code you write</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But as I did not declare any classes in my kotlin code I don't know how to get a class reference.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My current implementation is this</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>which is obviously very bad code.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So my question is, how do I obtain a class reference in kotlin without declaring any unneccesary classes.&#xA;Any hints appreciated :)</p>&#xA;

How Kotlin Higher-Order Functions work? <p>I'm struggling a bit to understand Higher-Order Functions and how to pass functions as parameters to other functions using Kotlin. I have a basic example that I want to fufill:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm calling the method above this way:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And  is declared as:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I know I passed null to the func when I declared it ('cause I need to pass something at compilation time), however, the call made from inside  is not made passing the parameter from runtime, I mean, in  I always get null for results.

In kotlin, how to return an instance defined by generic class parameter <p>I'm trying to write a nice Kotlin wrapper for a web framework against kotlin 1.0.3.

Kotlin extension function on mutable property <p>I'm trying to set an extension function on a mutable property so I can reassign the property in the extension function.

Is Groovy knowledge required to understand Gradle? <p>So, I've been trying to avoid build tools for a while, but started to use Gradle for some time now. I'm able to use it for simple things like letting it download dependencies, like it's intended, but I've seen people use it to do really advanced staff like manage large projects with different modules, native dependencies, publish to Github when building, etc.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I feel like I still need to copy-paste a lot when trying to do anything more complicated, because even after finding some documentation to read, I'm still not sure where language syntax like {, }, :, (, ), are meant to be used.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, my question is: Does it make sense to learn Groovy to understand Gradle better? Should reading the docs be enough? I'm not even asking because I would not be interested in Groovy, I'm just wondering how people got used to using Gradle and whether it makes sense to use it for more advanced tasks then fetching dependencies from repositories.</p>&#xA;
Spring Boot with AsyncRestTemplate Netty Client Fails <p>I have a Spring Boot 1.3.6 application, built out of the box and using the embedded Tomcat server. The application has a single endpoint doing a very simple echo request.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Later I defined a corresponding client invoking that simple endpoint using , however if my client uses the  the request fails, otherwise it succeeds. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My example below is in Kotlin, but it fails just the same in Java, so it does not have to do with the language I use to implement it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<h3>The Server</h3>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>My endpoint looks like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And the order data class is</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Note: Since I use Kotlin, I also added the <a href=\https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin\ rel=\nofollow\>Kotlin Jackson Module</a> to ensure proper constructor deserialization.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<h3>The Client</h3>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I then proceeded to create a client that invokes this endpoint.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If I do something like the following in my client, it works perfectly and I get a successful echo response.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>As mentioned above, the code above runs perfectly and prints a successful echo response.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<h3>The Problem</h3>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But if I decide to use the Netty client, then I get 400 Bad Request reporting I did not pass the body:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>When I do this then I get a  with a message saying \Required request body is missing\.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I debugged the Spring Boot code and I see that when the  is read, it always return -1 as if it was empty.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In my gradle I added , so I am using what, as of today, is the latest version of Netty. This Netty version has worked just fine when interacting with endpoints in other projects that I have that use regular Spring (i.e. not Spring Boot).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How come the  works fine, but the  fails? </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I thought it might had to do with the embedded Tomcat server, however, if I package this application as war and deploy it in an existing Tomcat server (i.e. not using the embedded one), the problem persists. So, I'm guessing is something related to Spring/Spring Boot.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Am I missing any configuration in my Spring Boot app? Any suggestions on how to make the Netty client work with Spring Boot?</p>&#xA;
Should properties of class in Kotlin be private and how to access them? <p>Aloha! While reading Kotling Language Reference I noticed that the keyword \private\ for properties of a class is never used (always default which is public). It also said that getters and setters are generated automatically.&#xA;So I created class and made its fields private. However, when I create object of the class, I cannot see the fields and no setters and getters are available, unless I write them myself.&#xA;So what's the rule here? Leave visibility modifier default (public) or make them private and provide mutator methods?&#xA;Thank you.</p>&#xA;

Should Kotlin files be put in a separate source directory in Android? <p>I'm going to start using Kotlin for Android development in addition to Java because of its benefits.

FXML control always null when using Kotlin <p>Using IntelliJ I created a JavaFX application and then added Kotlin and Maven as frameworks to it. It came with a sample.fxml file and a Controller.java and Main.java. I created a new class for the controller in Kotlin (MainWindowController.kt) and renamed the sample.fxml file to MainWindow.fxml. I updated the MainWindow.fxml to look like:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And in my MainWindowController.kt file I have:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here's my Main.java:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>When I run the app the print line shows that the label is null but otherwise the window shows properly and I see the text from my label.

Kotlin: Is there a way to clean up number overloads? <p>Often I find myself creating lots of overloads for number types because Kotlin  doesn't do implicit conversions for non-literals.

In Kodein dependency injection, how can you inject instances of Kodein itself into instances? <p>In Kodein, I have modules imported into a parent module, and sometimes the classes need an instance of Kodein so they can do injection themselves later.

With Kodein dependency injection, I don't want to pass around kodein instances everywhere <p>Using Kodein, I find I have to pass kodein instances around or inject them into modules and classes.  But sometimes I have classes that are so disconnected I want them just to be able to discover \one true Kodein\.  Since this is a server side app, and I only have one Kodein scope it should be easy.  I can create a global object, such as:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But that doesn't work when some of the modules are re-used across different projects and we cannot easily share this one instance.  Maybe a separate module just to hold the global would work, but then it would need to be a  and I'd prefer it not be changeable.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Can Kodein find a main, top-level or global scope on its own?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>this question is intentionally written and answered by the author (<a href=\http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/its-ok-to-ask-and-answer-your-own-questions/\>Self-Answered Questions</a>), so that the idiomatic answers to commonly asked Kotlin/Kodein topics are present in SO.</em></p>&#xA;
Java bean validation on Spring MVC Controller PathVariables <p>I am trying to get Java Bean validation annotations to work with path variables and query parameters in Spring MVC controller. (Environment: Spring Boot v1.3.5, Springxxx 4.2.6, programming language Kotlin 1.0.3)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>e.g.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have added org.springframework.validation.beanvalidation.MethodValidationPostProcessor as described in <a href=\https://raymondhlee.wordpress.com/2015/08/29/validating-spring-mvc-request-mapping-method-parameters/\ rel=\nofollow\>https://raymondhlee.wordpress.com/2015/08/29/validating-spring-mvc-request-mapping-method-parameters/</a> and also added org.springframework.validation.beanvalidation.LocalValidatorFactoryBean as the validatorFactory to the above. </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>}</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But when I annotate the Controller class (or the interface it implements) with &#xA;org.springframework.validation.annotation.Validated as suggested looks like the controller class is proxied (which seems to be as expected - <a href=\https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/3215\ rel=\nofollow\>https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/3215</a>). </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But this causes the Spring mvc request mapping setup to ignore the SomeController. Debugging through the Spring framework code looked like org.springframework.web.servlet.handler.AbstractHandlerMethodMapping.initHandlerMethods() goes through the list of beans and tries to detect handler methods but the above controller is ignored by the looks of it as it encounters a proxy instance and it doesn't carry the @Controller or @RequestMapping annotations.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Does anyone have any idea what's missing? There seems to be a lot of information out there that seem to suggest this should be possible, but couldn't find a working example .</p>&#xA;

Kotlin for android and static final inner classes <p>I'm trying to rewrite my android app on Kotlin, and I've faces problem while converting ContentProvider contract class.&#xA;So I have simple contract class (default stuff like content type and content uris is omitted):</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>If I understand correctly, in Kotlin we don't have static members. Instead of this, we have \companion objects\. So after converting it to Kotlin, I have this code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But when I'm trying to access fields like Contract.Contacts.NAME, I have error: \NAME has private access\.

With it, I can access static members directly, without calling getters.</p>&#xA;

Spring Boot Controller Locale Not Changing with Parameter <p>I'm having some trouble with using Spring Boot with Kotlin to handle locale.  I created these settings in my application.properties file:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Then created an autowired instance of MessageSource in my controller:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>When put a locale in the url as a parameter, the parameter doesn't seem to get picked up when I call , so it is always en_US.  Though, I can manually pick it up using  as a parameter to my controller function and use it from there in the controller function, but not in other functions.  I thought that spring boot LocaleContextHolder was supposed to hold the current locale based on the request URL automatically for the whole session.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I read an older article that mentioned using a LocaleChangeInterceptor bean as well as beans for MessageSource and LocaleResolver in your main class, but another article said Spring Boot doesn't require that.  I tried it anyway with no difference.  These are the functions I used:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Any suggestions on what to try next other than capturing the locale manually and making it a parameter in every function that gets called by the controller?  Thanks!</p>&#xA;
Could you please explain this piece of code in terms of C# code? <p>From the <a href=\https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/idioms.html#convenient-form-for-a-generic-function-that-requires-the-generic-type-information\>Kotlin documentation</a> page:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>In the code snippet above, I understand everything except that  thing.

Does Kotlin have method-CALL labels? <p>I'm moving from Swift to Kotlin, and loving it so far. However, I'm used to declaring methods like this (pretend the referenced methods exist and work):</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre class=\lang-Swift prettyprint-override\></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>and calling them like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre class=\lang-Swift prettyprint-override\></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>which is beautifully self-documenting and reads like English. However, in Kotlin, a similar method like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre class=\lang-Kotlin prettyprint-override\></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>which already starts to sound odd using a variable named . But then it gets worse when I call it:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre class=\lang-Kotlin prettyprint-override\></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>and here we see the biggest problem: One can likely guess by reading this line alone that  is a rectangle in which the circle will be drawn. However, what is ? It could be antialiasing, yes, but it could also be whether to draw it opaquely, or some toggle about whether to draw it at all! Anyway, I could cite more reasons why Swift and Objective-C programmers love their labels with method calls, but I've made my point.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Is there any way to enable labels on method <em>call</em> in Kotlin?</strong></p>&#xA;
RxJava - Backpressuring keyboard inputs? <p>Here's a fun RxJava problem. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I want to use RxJava backpressure operators to quickly lookup a typed input while each character is being typed, much like Google does on its search page. I went through the <a href=\https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/Backpressure\ rel=\nofollow\>Backpressure</a> documentation and I came up with this (I am using RxJavaFX/RxKotlinFX to leverage JavaFX). </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This works great. If I type \Hello\ against the control it will emit the  \Hello\ after 200 ms of no typing. But if I want this to truly be more responsive, I should actually have some sort of rolling accumulation for each keystroke input.  Then my console output should really look like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Those should be all my emissions when I type the word \Hello\, and the 200ms defines how much time should elapse before the accumulation resets. How do I do this?</p>&#xA;

Many small modules, or few large modules for best build performance? <p>A few years ago, when first adopting gradle for Android (before Gradle 2.0), I found that there was some overhead to using and depending upon a module, so I've stayed away from splitting my project into smaller modules, and instead have created very large modules. After trying out some other build systems (like Buck for instance), performance is gained by splitting your code into multiple small modules. Some of the modern programming languages like Kotlin even have visibility modifiers specifically built around the concept of splitting your code into modules.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We're currently at Gradle 2.14.1 (almost 3.0), and for the past several releases, they've quoted massive performance gains. With the changes to Gradle / the Android plugin the past few years, does it now produce faster builds to split your code into smaller modules, or to use fewer large modules?</p>&#xA;
Can a covariant type parameter be in an input position in the constructor? <p>In <a href=\https://stackoverflow.com/a/36753782/303685\>this answer</a>, <a href=\https://stackoverflow.com/users/170842/michael\>Michael</a> suggests that the generic type parameter be made co-variant in order to allow the creation of an empty node.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I get that the generic type parameter is in all output positions since all the properties of the  and its sub-types are read-only ('s).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But it <em>does</em> have the type parameter in an input position in the constructor.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I thought that that code wouldn't work in C# so I tried it out and, to my surprise, it worked just fine.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I realize now that in doing this exercise, I learnt something new about variance.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>So, my first question is:</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><em>Are co-variant type parameters allowed in input positions in constructors? In what other places are type parameters allowed to disregard their variance qualifiers?</em></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Another thing I learnt about variance is that the variant generic type parameter may not even appear in the variant interface declaration as seen in the example below.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>You'll see that the  interface does not have  in either input or output positions. This also came as a shock to me.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>My second question is:</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><em>And the other question I have is, what is the C# equivalent of the  type in Kotlin? The answer says that  is the most sub-type that cannot further be derived. It is the exact opposite of  (or the most base type in other languages).</em></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>To emulate that code in C#, it didn't make sense to have this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Because that's just illegal C# code and  also doesn't seem analogous to .</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, I had to fake a dummy like so to imitate the  class declaration.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>My third and final question is:</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><em>Therefore, my final question is, is there a place that contains an exhaustive list of all the types available in Kotlin along with their descriptions? Because even though the <a href=\https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/basic-types.html\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>Basic Types page</a> lists most of the common ones, it seems not to be an exhaustive list.

What are the rules of semicolon inference in Kotlin? &#xA;&#xA;<p>This is what the <a href=\https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/grammar.html\ rel=\nofollow\>grammar</a> page says. This seems to imply that there is a need to specify semicolons in some cases, but it doesn't specify them, and the grammar tree below doesn't exactly make this obvious. Also I have suspicions that there are some cases where this feature may not work correctly and cause problems.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So the question is when should one insert a semicolon and what are the corner cases one needs to be aware of to avoid writing erroneous code?</p>&#xA;
Lifecycle methods in statically typed languages <p>In the last year I've become a mobile developer and a functional programming admirer.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In each of the mobile arenas there are components with lifecycle methods that make up the meat of the app. The following will use Android and Kotlin as examples, but the same applies to iOS and Swift.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In Android, there are 's with lifecycle methods like . You might also define a function, , which will do exactly what the name describes.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For the purposes of the question, let's say there's a variable defined in  that is used in a button click handler  (<em>This is usually the case -  is essentially 's setup method</em>).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The example class would look like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Notice the declaration of  as a  (nullable string) and the use of  (null safe call). These are required because the compiler cant guarantee that  will be called before . As developers though, <a href=\https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#ActivityLifecycle\ rel=\nofollow\>we know that  will always be called first</a><strong>*</strong> <strong>**</strong>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My question is <strong>how can I tell the compiler about the guaranteed order of these methods and eliminate the null checking behavior?</strong> </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>* I suppose it's possible to  up our  and call  directly, thus sidestepping the Android framework and lifecycle methods, but the compiler/JVM would likely run into an error before anything interesting happened.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>** The guarantee that  is called first is provided by the Android framework, which is an external source of truth and might break/function differently in the future. Seeing that all Android apps are based on this source of truth though, I believe it's safe to trust.</p>&#xA;
Reverting source code to Java after IntelliJ's Kotlin > Java conversion <p>So I wanted to try out converting our backend API source code which is written in Java and see how it looks (IIRC there is a preview before converting), but once I did it it automatically started converting all the files in the selected folders, and in the end it asked for code corrections, which I responded with no as I wanted to cancel it and now I am stuck with a broken code base with no other options than: </p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Reverting to the last git commit and reimplementing all the changes done from my side (I could have prevented it but committing before the conversion but oh well)</li>&#xA;<li>Continue using Kotlin to code in but I have code errors which I don't know how to fix</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What I am asking instead is if there's anyway to convert Kotlin back to Java in IntelliJ IDEA?

Does Kotlin provide any implementations of its collection interfaces? <p>I see that Kotlin provides a number of interfaces for implementing collections. They are listed on <a href=\https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/index.html\ rel=\nofollow\>this page</a>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I do not see any implementations of these provided by Kotlin.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I do, however, see that there are functions in the global namespace that help us create instances of these collections. For e.g. to create a mutable list of numbers, we may say:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>To create a read-only view of the list, we may say:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Or, to create a read-only list of numbers, we may say:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>To create a list of  items and initialize each element with the value , we might say:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>To create an Array, say, 5 elements with an initializer function for each element of the array, we may say:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, if I'd like to create a  without any books in it but I'd simply like to initialize it like this (Java or C# code):</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>How may I do that in Kotlin?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Are there publicly exposed implementations of its collection interfaces?

Progress bar binding lost after async task finishes <p>I have a view holder with a button, imageview and progress bar as elements of a recyclerview</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The adapter has an onclicklistener interface for the view holder </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The recycler view with setHasFixedSize(true) is inflated in a fragment.The fragment implements the onClickListener interface.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>OnCreateView of the fragment, I display 5 items in the recycler view each with empty imageviews by binding the adapter to an arraylist of 5 empty image model.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The idea is to click the button to populate the imageview with an image  from the camera.

In Kotlin, how do I integrate a Kovenant promise with Elasticsearch async responses? <p>I use Kovenant in my Kotlin application, and I'm calling Elasticsearch which has its own async API.  I would rather use promises but the best I can come up with is something like:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Which makes an Kovenant async task thread, then Elasticsearch uses a thread from its pool, and then  synchronously blocks Elasticsearch to get back a result.  It seems silly to spawn new threads while blocking others.  Is there an approach to integrate the thread dispatching more closely?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>this question is intentionally written and answered by the author (<a href=\http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/its-ok-to-ask-and-answer-your-own-questions/\>Self-Answered Questions</a>), so that solutions for interesting problems are shared in SO.</em></p>&#xA;

I have a Vertx request and I need to calculate an externally visible (public) URL <p>I am using Vertx 3 with Kotlin, and at times I need to return a specific URI from the perspective of the public URL which is not the same as what the Vertx-web request thinks my URL is.  This is likely due to my load balancer or proxy receiving one URL, and then forwarding to my application on an internal URL.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So if I do this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I end up with a URL like  instead of .

In Vertx I need to redirect all HTTP requests to the same URL but for HTTPS <p>I have written a Vertx-web handler in Koltin that redirects any request I receive that is HTTP to HTTPS, and I'm using  to determine if the request is not SSL, and this worked fine until I put my code behind a load balancer.  If the load balancer talks to my Vertx-web server on HTTPS then it thinks all user requests are HTTPS even if they are not.  And if I change the load balancer to talk to Vertx-web on HTTP then every request is redirected endlessly even if already the user is using HTTPS.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Then I also see another problem, that the redirect using  goes to the private address instead of the publically available address that the user is actually talking to.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there a handler in Vertx-web that I'm missing that does this, or some idiomatic way to solve this?   Should I just do this from JavaScript since it sees the real user address instead of trying a server-side redirect?  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm coding in Kotlin, so any examples for that language are great! </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>this question is intentionally written and answered by the author (<a href=\http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/its-ok-to-ask-and-answer-your-own-questions/\>Self-Answered Questions</a>), so that solutions for interesting problems are shared in SO.</em></p>&#xA;

How to set Kotlin default property value to `this` <p>I have following class structure which represents simple tree. Each item can have multiple children and parent.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The tree root is causing me a headache though. I'm trying to do this without using  so I can traverse the tree upwards by calling . To simplify it I want the root to has itself as a parent, but I cannot figure out how to do it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>That code doesn't compile, because it's not possible to reassign the . But using  as a default parameter value is also not possible. Is there any way out?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If I allow the parent to be nullable, then the solution is easy. But I don't wanna use the nulls, if possible. Also  would defeat the  chain.</p>&#xA;

I have to restart IDE to run tests <p>Weird bug with Android Studio 2.2 when running a single test directly in IDE - I'll either have \No tests found\ or run my previously compiled test.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Example:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'll create this test, and get the \No tests found\. So I restart, and test is found! Obviously, the above test passes because it's empty. Next, I want my test to fail. So I manually throw an exception and add one line of code, below.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now I recompile, and this test passes too, because IntelliJ is for some reason has cached the previous test and reruns that. To get this test to properly fail - I must restart the IDE.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Anyone know what's going on? Note - I'm using Kotlin pretty heavily in this project.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>EDIT 2: This is a JVM test (non-android, ) in an android <em>library</em> project.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>EDIT: here's a full test class</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;

Why is the Scala compiler giving me an error when passing a Kotlin sealed class into a constructor? <p>I have a sealed class, written in Kotlin:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And another class that takes  as a parameter:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In Scala I have a class that, among other things, get an instance of the  and then create an instance of the .</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The scala compiler ends up printing this error message:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>If I cast  using  I get another, not so useful, error:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Overall, I have no idea why this is happening.  If I make the constructor take the parent class as a parameter rather than nested class, it compiles just fine (which is my workaround for now).  If I do the same type of thing, except having written the sourcecode in Java rather than Kotlin, this error does not happen.

Explanation of @Configuration @AutoConfigureAfter with Kotlin <p>I am a python dev and totally new to Spring boot and gradle. However i am fine with java and Trying my best with Kotlin. I was trying to run Spring Boot application(Kotlin) on localhost.

No coverage report for inlined Kotlin methods <p>Kotlin functions marked with  keyword are, well, inlined during the compilation and it seems that code coverage tools (like <em>JaCoCo</em>) fail to properly calculate code coverage.

Is there a way to make BigDecimal faster than I have here? <p>I'm working on some financial analysis software that will need to process large (ish) volumes of data. I'd like to use BigDecimal for the accuracy (some pricing info goes to four or five digits to the right of the decimal) but I was concerned about speed.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I wrote the following test app and it appears that BigDecimal can be 90 to 100 times slower than Doubles. I knew there would be a delta, but that's more than I was expecting. Here's a typical output after many trials.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Am I missing something?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here is the code. I tried to make it representative of real world. I created a constant where I could (pi) but also did some inline math of numbers that would vary from data row to data row - such as pi * BigDecimal(i) + BigDecimal(1). My point being that avoiding constructors can't be the only answer.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Fortunately, it appears Double has enough precision anyway since numbers will be typically in the format 00000.00000. Any hidden gotchas I should know about, though? Do people use Double for financial analysis software?</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;

dynamic dsl using kotlin with content assist <p>Does kotlin help building the following dsl ?</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>in this dsl, the following are static parts</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>but, the expression</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>is to be supported dynamically. Meaning, the application knows about various domain models that are navigable by the '/' separated syntax. the IDE (Intellij), should give me the content assist when I invoke it . For example, after GET if I type a '/' and invoke ca , it should give me the following options </p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>userstore</li>&#xA;<li>bookstore</li>&#xA;<li>buildings&#xA;etc</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The fact is, I do not not know these entries at development time. I can write code that can return these entries. I need the editor to invoke my code and get the content assist candidates. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>And, I need the build to flag errors if the expression is formed with invalid tokens. So, I need the editor to keep checking with my code and when a token is not found in the returned list of candidates should flag error in the editor. </p>&#xA;

So the problem is how to convert it to SerializedLambda.</p>&#xA;
Get KProperty of a non-package extension property <p>In kotlin, you can use the reference operator to get the KProperty of a package extension property like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, when the extension property is declared inside a class the reference operator no longer works:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>So what I am wondering is how can I change the problematic line in the second example, so the KProperty is gotten?</p>&#xA;

Is it possible to reuse a layout in Kotlin Anko <p>I read that the most benefit of using Anko is its reusability. But i could't find its exact example.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Currently in the new Android layout system, the boiler plate is like below:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>From the layout structure above, only  is varry. And &#xA;in many cases those ceremonial setup duplicated almost in every activity. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So here with Anko im thinking if there is a reusable solution about that issue. Im not expecting it will be reusable for general purpose layout, but et least i can minimize the ceremonial code in the project. Maybe i need something like:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>From the code above im expecting  will do all the ceremonial setup for the root layout such as (DrawerLayout, CoordinatorLayout etc etc).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is that possible?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>EDIT</strong>&#xA;So i think my question is: <strong>How to make a custom component which can host other component</strong></p>&#xA;

Platform Declaration Clash with Comparable <p>I'm getting a Platform Declaration Clash error from the compiler resulting from multiple default implementations of the Comparable interfaces (demonstrated below).</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I understand why I'm getting this error; both default implementations of  map to  in Java.

How to properly do null checks using Kotlin extension functions on an Android Activity <p>I'm new to Kotlin and trying to convert one of the many Android Util methods we have in our existing codebase into a Kotlin extension function.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is the Kotlin code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Which is meant to be the equivalent of this Java method:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, I'm still getting  in the Kotlin code whenever an  is .

Adding int and int? in Kotlin <p>I ran into a problem, which seems so simple that everyone should have ran into it at some point or another, yet failed to find a solution anywhere.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Copied from the REPL:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>So what I'm trying to do is add together an Int and an Int? and I'd like the result to be an Int. Very simple. I'm of course aware of the  operator, however I want to avoid using this whenever possible, as it is not change-safe†. </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I am aware of the following solution, which handles null-safety and avoids the use of the  operator.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>My question is the following: Is there a way to do addition with the use of an if-else block and/or a when block, which does not require the use of the  operator. My reason for preferring the use of if-else and not the Elvis operator is intelligibility for people from languages without an Elvis operator. So I'd like to get as close to  as possible.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thank you, if my problem or motivation is unclear or contrary to the design or intent of Kotlin, please let me know.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>† Sure, I may be able to assert that some variable is safe at the time when it's added, but this assertion will remain there even as code around it changes, possibly making the assertion invalid, thus negating one of Kotlin's points: null safety.</p>&#xA;
Kotlin Runtime errors on basic operators <p>I am running a project on IntelliJ that has a mix of kotlin and Java; when I build the project I get a heap of errors which shouldnt occur. for example, the following code throws the error:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Error:(129, 23) Kotlin: Unresolved reference: +=</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Obviously these are just basic operations and shouldn't fail. When I click on the error message it doesn't show an error in the actual code file. Perhaps my configuration is wrong? If so; how to go about fixing it?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>There are many other errors that throw on basic operations like the one above. </p>&#xA;
Create a custom View/ViewGroup class in Anko DSL <p>I want to create a custom View which is just a wrapper of some Android Views. I looked into creating a custom ViewGroup which manages the layout of it's child views, but I don't need such complexity. What I basically want to do is something like:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The reason is that I'd like to move the SwipeLayout code into a separate file but don't want to do any complex layout stuff myself.

RxJava Schedulers.immediate() behavior while Unit Testing <p>I am trying to write test for my DAO object that uses reactive interface. I have a table with recipes and I want to test that when I insert data to this table, the subscriber receives list with recipes. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I am using TestSubscriber class and performing asserts on that class. My simple test look like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The problem is that assertion  fails because no item was emitted. But when I insert this line above&#xA;, the test is successful. My observable does not emit terminal event and therefore the timeout is performed, but in the meantime of waiting, the onNext was called with list of recipes. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My getRecipes method:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>How is that possible? I thought that when I use Schedulers.immediate(), the operation will be performed on the same thread and my TestSubscriber receives the events.  If not, how should I write this test so it succeeds? I want to test that onNext is called and I don't want to insert artificial sleep commands between. </p>&#xA;
Android Kotlin Moshi Custom Json Adapter <p>Ok so i have the following Json Pojo:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And i want to write a customs deserialiser, so the final object will look like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Basically, the mappings are:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li><p></p></li>&#xA;<li><p> based on some value inside JProduct</p></li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The JCategory two lists will be joint into 1, in which will contain more JCategory plus Prod1/Prod2.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is this a valid and efficient way of mapping the data in this adapter according to Moshi?</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Notice that i have a JCategory and inside a list of the same object,&#xA;so i thought the Adapter would parse this automatically but it doesn't. So i tried  and it worked. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So my questions are:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>is  the proper way of handling cases like this?</li>&#xA;<li>how can i map an object to another one/other based on some property inside it?

Kotlin delegating to a future <p>I am trying to learn Kotlin and delegates are both interesting and confusing.

I am using Kotlin 1.0.4 with Gradle. On another note I am not positive inlining this is actually providing a performance improvement, I am still a bit unclear about crossinline.

Kotlin. How to check if the field is nullable via reflection? <p>I'm developing a code generator that takes the data from the classes during runtime. This generator is designed to work only with Kotlin. At the moment, I was faced with the problem, as I don't know how to check if the field is nullable. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So the main question is how to implement this check via reflection?</p>&#xA;

React to retrofit call <p>I have an app that has a viewpager with 4 fragments. I want to populate all the fragments with data from my server. I load the data in the activity and I want to distribute it to all the fragments.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So I have this signature:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And I call the method and populate a List.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And then I have a method to get a Observable from this list:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And I get then in my fragments:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Well... this should work, but It doesn't. It happens that the first of my fragments gets empty while the forth have data. (second and third are not supposed to have any data... and they don't) </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So I think: When the fragment gets created, the list is still empty, so the Observable in the activity has nothing to provide... But when the view pager get's in the forth fragment, the List is not null anymore, so my screen shows the data. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My problem is: <strong>How do I make the Observable in the activity keep pushing the data into the fragments?</strong> Right now, it only push data when the Observable is subscriped... I want to change this, so it pushes when there is new data.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>(I think that the first Observable should comunicate directly with the Subject, bit I'm not sure how to do that...)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Any help is appreciated!</p>&#xA;

Robolectric: Test-only Activity with AppCompat Theme <p>I currently have a library project that defines an abstract activity class that extends AppCompatActivity and provides some nontrivial functionality that needs to be tested.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I would like to avoid instrumentation tests since all other tests in the project are written in Robolectric. However, I can't seem to figure out how to properly test this activity using Robolectric.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The problem is that the Activity is not in the manifest, so I can't specify the theme, hence all tests fail with the \You need to use a Theme.AppCompat theme (or descendant) with this activity.\ error.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I first tried to create a custom manifest and load it using the @Config(manifest = ...), but the manifest couldn't be found. So I tried to move the activity to the main source set and added it to the real manifest, hoping that Robolectric will find it there. Nope, still getting \No such manifest file: build/intermediates/manifests/full/debug/AndroidManifest.xml\. Actually, this path does not seem to change, so I suspect that the config option is not working at all.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, to sum up:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>How do you properly use @Config(manifest = ...) with library projects?</li>&#xA;<li>How do you test an Activity with custom theme that isn't declared in the main source set? (assuming the manifest option doesn't work)</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For the sake of completeness:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>I have the @RunWith(RobolectricTestRunner::class) properly set</li>&#xA;<li>All other tests seem to work fine, except for this one.</li>&#xA;<li>Fails both in AndroidStudio and in pure Gradle build</li>&#xA;<li>Robolectric 3.1.4</li>&#xA;<li>Gradle Android plugin 2.2.2</li>&#xA;<li>Gradle 3.1</li>&#xA;<li>I tried playing with <a href=\https://github.com/nenick/AndroidStudioAndRobolectric/blob/master/app/src/test/java/com/example/myapplication/CustomRobolectricRunner.java\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>this</a> custom runner quite a bit, but no luck - it actually managed to change the manifest path, but then Robolectric fails on some internal null pointer exception... </li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Edit: I managed to get rid of the missing manifest error using the custom test runner, but I still get that invalid theme error. Specifically, I now have an activity in the main source set, properly specified in the main manifest, the manifest is properly loaded into Robolectric (at least it seems to be), but the theme is still not set properly :/ </p>&#xA;

How do I get the result of a Cucumber feature <p>I'm trying to run Cucumber features in JUnit 5 Jupiter. I've lifted some code from the Cucumber-jvm source and adapted it for JUnit 5's . It is working: I see my features running when I run all JUnit tests (this is Kotlin code, but the same applies to Java):</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, JUnit reports that every feature was successful, whether or not it actually was. When features fail, the results are correctly pretty-printed, but the generated  passes. Neither  nor Intellij notice the error: I have to inspect the text output.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I think I have to figure out, in the  passed as the second parameter to , what the result of the feature was, and raise an assertion when appropriate. How do I determine the result of  or  at that point?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>And is there a way to get at the results for each scenario in the feature? Or better, is there a way to run a specific scenario, so that I can create a DynamicTest for each scenario, giving me better reporting granularity in JUnit?</p>&#xA;

Strange \Unresolved reference:\ error after upgrading to Kotlin 1.0.5 <p>I have a project that contains 2 modules. A Java module that contains my java code.

Whatever was the latest in June.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now I have updated to the latest Kotlin version.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But one of my java module java classes cannot be referenced anymore from the Kotlin module. It is only 1 of the classes, the Kotlin module references a lot of other classes from the Java module just fine still.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I am hoping someone can tell me what is going on.

Sealed inner classes <p>I'd like to create a closed universe of classes, where each subclass is an inner class of some outer class. I thought I could use a sealed inner class for the base of the hierarchy, like so:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Note that </p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li> is a proper class, which can have many different instances. Each instance should be able to create 's that will call the right </li>&#xA;<li>The universe of  subclasses is finite</li>&#xA;<li> has some instance method, to be used by various  subclasses, which accesses 's non-static method </li>&#xA;<li>The concrete subclasses of  (e.g. ) pass arguments to 's constructor</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, the problem with this is that I don't know how I can construct a value of type  in . I was hoping that this would work:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>but this fails with </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I guess the problem is that  is actually an inner class of , so I'd need an instance of  before I could construct an instance of . However, this is not what I'd like; I'd like  to just be a base class for my  etc. classes, with some  functionality which is shared between all subclasses and which access 's instance data.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>One workaround I've found is to make  non-:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But then the subclasses of  are no longer closed.</p>&#xA;

Why doesn't rearrange code work in Kotlin files in Intellij? <p>I love Jetbrain's Idea IDE and its ergonomics. One of my favorite tools is idea's rearrange code 'action'(you can bring it up by hitting ). It rearranges the code in the java file to put methods in alphabetical order and order the fields in an organized fashion that the user defines. For whatever reason, it doesn't work with Jetbrain's own language, kotlin :(. This sucks even more with the fact that kotlin quickfixes the fields right <em>above</em> the method instead of the beginning of the file like most java files. When is Idea going to support rearrange code for kotlin files?</p>&#xA;

When I try to access this field from another class I have to use non-null check: .

I've tried to get the last element of the list in the template and it worked ok (second output), so is that a bug or I am missing something when using an extension property?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I am using kotlin 1.0.5</p>&#xA;
Cancel superseded task in ThreadPool in Java/Kotlin <p>I'm trying to figure out how to cancel a task in a  if a new tasks comes along that supersedes it.

The problem is, the locking is taking place inside the future that doesn't exist yet.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I know you're never supposed to force kill a locked thread (I don't even know how since it's a ), so what is the proper way to do this?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Edit</strong>: My question is different from <a href=\https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1418033/java-executors-how-can-i-stop-submitted-tasks\>this one</a> as I don't have access to the future to cancel it (the lock isn't put in place till the  picks it up, and by that point the  could have been submitted multiple times, and I don't know which would own the lock). If I did it would be a piece of cake (the code to handle interruption is already in place). How should I change my code to get a reference to the future (or even the thread) that owns the lock?</p>&#xA;

Issue converting Java bean with inheritance to Kotlin <p>On the current Java class we have 2 Java beans Clazz1 and Clazz2 where both extend super class SuperClazz. We also have a list where we iterate the super class entries which can be Clazz1 or Clazz2:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>We now need to convert the code to Kotlin but since <em>data class</em> does not support inheritance we are unsure on the best way to tackle the issue, do we just create a standard Kotlin class with variables, extends the super class, and manually craft the getter-setters?

Spring data mongodb and kotlin <p>I am running into a problem when using spring data mongodb togheter with kotlin. When i try to read objects from mongodb, i get an error complaining that my data classes don't have a default no-args constructor. I can solve this by giving every field a value in my data class, so the compiler will generate a default no-args constructor. Off course i don't really want to do this.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I know there is a jackson kotlin module and it is included in my maven file. It works for deserializing objects that i get over http, so i know that spring picks it up. It seems however that spring data mongodb doesn't use the jackson objectmapper?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there a way i can use the jackson objectmapper in spring data mongodb or fix the problem of not having a non args constructor?</p>&#xA;

Why doesn't spring-data-elasticsearch use the objectmapper from the spring context <p>I am developing an application that uses spring-data-elasticsearch for the data storage. I am also writing this application using kotlin. This has some special quirks, one being that jackson needs the jackson-module-kotlin (to get rid of the problems with no args constructor). I also use the jackson-datatype-jsr310 module.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Spring boot is nice enough to pick these modules up from the classpath and register them automatically. I also have the write-dates-as-timestamps option set to false. However spring-data-elasticsearch seems to be oblivious to it. I figured that it is because the DefaultEntityMapper news an objectmapper and doesn't use the one from the spring context. I was wondering why? I fixed it by providing some extra configuration that makes sure that spring-data-elasticsearch uses the objectmapper that i get from the spring context:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there a better/easier way to make sure spring-data-elasticsearch uses the objectmapper from the context?</p>&#xA;

I could move API to some third project and then build - publish - add dependency on it but that's a lot of work during development.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is it a good idea to move them to the single project so it will look the way:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks</p>&#xA;
Android Espresso tests (written in Kotlin) cannot see main classes and packages <p>I have an issue with Kotlin Espresso tests. I have applied  Gradle plugin in the module's build script, and the tests run without issues in Android Studio (the test class is annotated and run by  runner), but running the Gradle task “assembleDebugAndroidTest\ from terminal fails to find my main classes and packages (classes used in the tests).  It throws an  error.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here is the sourceSets section of the build script:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And test dependencies in the module:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Project's build script:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm using version 1.0.5-2 of Kotlin. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We have a custom test runner as  which registers some idling resources and some activity hook for unlocking device screen and acquiring the wake lock, and uses TestButler for disabling animations and stabilizing tests.

Best way to use BufferedReader in Kotlin <p>So I've just started using Kotlin for Android (in hopes that it might help me with Swift as well), and converted my Android Java codes into Kotlin.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In one of the conversions, I stumbled upon a BufferedReader, which I would usually write in Java (or rather C#) as the following:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But in Kotlin, it seems that Kotlin doesn't allow me to assign values to variables in while conditions.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Currently, I've written the code as the following:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>which I don't find so elegant (and prev-gen, despite using Kotlin).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What would be the best way to use BufferedReader in Kotlin?</p>&#xA;

What's the intended use of @JvmSynthetic in Kotlin? <p>I have come across the <a href=\https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.jvm/-jvm-synthetic/index.html\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\></a> annotation in kotlin-stdlib, and I'm wondering what it is for, but, unfortunately, it is undocumented. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>As far as I understand, applying it to a program element will add the  modifier to the corresponding bytecode elements. As a consequence, the element becomes invisible from Java:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Somewhere in Java code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But the same elements are still visible in Kotlin code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is hiding declarations from non-Kotlin sources a valid use of ? Is it the intended use? What are the other appropriate use cases?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Since  hides functions from Java, they cannot be overridden in Java either (and when it comes to an  member, the calls then result into ). Given that, can I use  to prohibit overriding members of a Kotlin class in Java sources?</p>&#xA;
Public fields for Java compatibility <p>I found recent interest in Kotlin as a language, because the platform we develop for is Java 6 based and hence lacks any syntactic sugar the recent years brought to Java.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>There's but one thing that makes it impossible to use Kotlin over Java in development, that is, the platform we develop for uses some reflection internally and requires members to be public. It won't work otherwise. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, the bytecode generated from the Kotlin file in fact produces public getters and setters, the fields themselves yet remain private.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Is there a way to overcome this, so I get real public fields?</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I am aware of the design failure that requires public fields, but the system is kind of a black box to us, we cannot change the fact that it has to be this way.</p>&#xA;

But instead it bothers me with compilation error saying : </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Smartcast to  is impossible because  is a propery that has open or custom getter.</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I thought maybe error is because activity can be nullable so I tried:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But it didn't work and compilation failed with same error.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, following code works fine:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Its okay but above error doesn't seem to explain anything about why smartcast fails.

How to compare a Class<*> against a Java boxed primitive type without kotlin compiler warnings <p>I'm using Kotlin to write something that works with Java's reflection APIs. My input is a  and I need to decide whether that type is a double or integer, but I need to support both primitives <em>and</em> the boxed nullable types that Java uses.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This toy example does what I'm trying to do:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But, this approach generates the following warnings from the Kotlin compiler:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>However,  is a syntax error, <a href=\https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35946044/kotlin-reflection-check-nullable-types\>the approaches suggested on an earlier question</a> require a  instead of a  (and the <a href=\https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/master/core/runtime.jvm/src/kotlin/jvm/JvmClassMapping.kt#L86\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\> extension method</a> crashes on some of my inputs). What's the correct Kotlin way to perform this kind of check?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Further investigation (prompted by @voddan's answer) has revealed that this problem is a symptom of a more general bit of weirdness in Kotlin's type reflection:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>So it seems not all s are created equal.

Match response handler with request in VertX <p>Let's say I have a Load Balancer (LB) in front of 1..n VertX (V) instances, each VertX instance is connected to a queue (Q), and I have 1..m Backends (BE).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>A user clicks on a button which makes a post request or even opens a web socket, the load balancer forwards the request to one of the VertX instances, which fires a request to the queue, one of the Backends consumes the message and sends a response back; if the correct VertX instance consumes it, it can lookup the response handler and write a response to the user, if the wrong VertX instance consumes it, there won't be a response handler to write a response to and the user will wait indefinitely for a response.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>See this sketch:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href=\https://i.stack.imgur.com/1FD94.png\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\><img src=\https://i.stack.imgur.com/1FD94.png\ alt=\enter image description here\></a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Alternatively, V2 dies and the load balancer reconnects the user to V1 which means even if I could send it back to the exact same one that made the request, it's not guaranteed to still be there once the response comes back, but the user might still be there awaiting a response via another VertX instance.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What I'm currently doing is to generate a GUID for each new connection, then as soon as the websocket connects, store the websocket handler inside a hashmap against the GUID and then when the BE wants to respond, it does a fanout to all 1..n VertX instances, the one that currently has the correct GUID in its hashmap can then write a response to the user.&#xA;Same for handling POST / GET in this manner.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Pseudocode:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This does however mean that if I have a 1000 VertX applications running, that the backend will need to fanout its message to a 1000 frontend instances of which only one will make use of the message.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>VertX seems like it already takes care of async operations very well, is there a way in VertX to identify each websocket connection instead of having to maintain a map of GUIDs mapped to websocket handlers / post handlers?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also, referring to the picture, is there a way for V3 to consume the message, but still be able to write a response back to the websocket handler that's currently connected to V2?</p>&#xA;

Why don't property initializers call a custom setter? <p>From the <a href=\https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/properties.html#getters-and-setters\ rel=\noreferrer\>Kotlin documentation</a>, custom setters are allowed:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But you cannot have a custom setter without a custom getter (and initialize from the  block):</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Although you can have a custom getter without a custom setter, no problem here:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>So why can't you use a custom setter with a property initialized from within the  block, and why does the  block invoke the custom setter while the property initializer assigns directly, bypassing the custom setter?</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;

Kotlin - possibly incorrectly reporting an unused code <p>I have a base class for all activities in my app. I want a variable  to be of type . This is how I declared the variable in Kotlin:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The problem is that in Android studio I get the part \\ grayed out and the popup message says: \No cast needed\</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If I follow the AS advice and I remove the casting, I get compiler errors when I am trying to assign the variable using other activities deriving from BaseActivity. The following code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>gives me an error \Type inference failed. Expected type mismatch: required , found \.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This causes problems mainly when I am committing code changes because the options \Cleanup\ and \Optimize imports\ in AS commit wizard are checked, which removes \unused\ code (the \as Class\ part), which is in fact actually used. <strong>The solution is not to turn these options off because I actually want them to be set to true.</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If I commit my changes, go to the class where the casting is used and undo the changes, it asks me \Undo Optimize Imports before commit?\. If I confirm, I get the casting back, so I know this is causing the issue.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>PS: I use Kotlin 1.0.5-3</p>&#xA;

Kotlin - Usefulness of \computed\ var properties? <p>I noticed that when I have a  property with a custom , that does not use the  identifier, a backing field is generated anyway. I checked the bytecode, and the documentation says so as well:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Consider a class like this. Since it's a  property, a default  (and therefore a backing field) will be generated:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, the  will always print \green\, no matter what I set  to. The backing field will be set to \blue\ anyway.<br>&#xA;Since there is no way to access it outside the accessor methods (or via reflection) I really can't think of a reason for this.<br>&#xA;Am I missing something here? Maybe a usecase or another way of accessing the backing field? Or is it just a bug (or a missing warning in IntelliJ)?</p>&#xA;

Kotlin visibility of nested members <p>I have a class with a nested, private class. I have a , standard Java builder pattern, that constructs instances of this class.

I also want it because my object is complicated to construct and I want it to be immutable so I have a builder with lots of setters, adders, vals, etc. and then in  I construct a single immutable .</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The only alternatives I see are:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>Instead of have a  in my builder save all the info necessary to construct one and then construct it in .

Kotlin generics inheritance - Type mismatch <p>I am trying to build a set of providers for realm objects. &#xA;Here is an example structure I've tried to build:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Interface:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Base provider class with companion function for typed provider instantiation:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And here is a child class:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Problem I have is on the line</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I can't figure out why it does not see that E is actually SomeChildProvider.&#xA;Thank you.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>P.S. I know that I can cast it to E, but in my opinion, it should not be needed in this situation. Maybe I am missing something obvious here or probably lack of Kotlin knowledge.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>UPDATE1:</strong>&#xA;After the first answer, we have realized that code above does not make much sense since we have to define a type of returning provider and to pass it into create method. Initial idea was that create method returns some type which is BaseProvider subtype. Here are the changes I have made in order to support the initial idea:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>IDataProvider</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>BaseProvider</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>ChildProvider</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>UI call</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Although, createModel method returns RealmObject, it's instance will be of ChildRealmModel. What I don't like about it is that we have to inspect instance type and cast into if we need exact model somewhere else.</p>&#xA;

Kotlin: What are named lambda arguments used for? <p>In Kotlin, it is possible to give lambda arguments names in their definition.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>As you can see,  and  are named in the lambda.

Do they change the compile output in some way? And are there any tricks you can use them for?</p>&#xA;

Converting Android project with databinding from Java to Kotlin <p>I have a large Android project written in Java and am currently converting it to Kotlin. Many of my activites and fragments use databinding.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Initially, when I converted my first activity using databinding to Kotlin, the project was unable to build for this activity. The error said there were missing references to the databinding library. I added:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>to dependencies in  and also</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>to the same file.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>After building, the Kotlin activity with databinding worked, whereas all the remaining Java databinding activites now report that the databinding package reference does not exist.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This leaves me in a tough spot. I was planning on converting the activities and fragments one by one to Kotlin and building them as I go, but this seems not doable at the moment since I have to make a choice between Java or Kotlin working at every build.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I found Kotterknife: <a href=\https://github.com/JakeWharton/kotterknife\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>https://github.com/JakeWharton/kotterknife</a> , which is a view injection library for Kotlin, but I still cannot believe that there is no way to slowly convert your activities from Java to Kotlin, even if they do use databinding. It simply does not seem credible to me.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Has anyone done converted a project in such a way in the past and succeeded without having to make a choice one or the other? Is there a way to convert single activities as you go along? The other option is to just convert all the Java to Kotlin in one go and then make one single build after it's all done, but that seems a bit risky if you put in all the work and then realize you overlooked something. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.</p>&#xA;

How to prevent kotlin.Unit object from being stripped by Proguard <p>Proguard stripes  standalone object (in Kotlin runtime library), and that causes a compilation error if you are using this type.

Fragment as internal class <p>If I declare my fragment as private class, IDE will warn me that it should be public and if I ignore it app will crash at runtime.

How to solve this null check in initializer safely? <p>I'm writing a test case which I need some private properties. Since those private data are generated from a private method, I decided to use reflection to retrieve them after calculation is done. Later I remembered the delegated properties and decide to write a general delegate. Here is the code I got so far:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>As you can see, property  is initialized by  calls, and, if  is set, subsequent calls will use that cache instead of keeping calling expensive reflection.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The very unfortunate thing is that at (a) compiler complains because T may be a nullable type and late init mechanism will be broken, but if I initialize it with  and it still complains because T may be a non-null type and null-safety is broken.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Currently, I made this to work by initializing it with the return value of a null-returning Java function. I inspected the bytecode generated and found kotlin compiler placed no null checks for that so it will work for now, but I'm worried that a future kotlin version will have such checks and ruin this trick. How I'm supposed to overcome this?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now I'm using this, below code is released to public domain.

The error:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I can't even name the arguments because Kotlin doesn't let argument naming for non-Kotlin functions.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Replaced the <em>E</em> generic type parameter with plain <em>String</em> references in the Java method headers, and it worked! So I guess this to be an incompatibility of type inference with generic types or something like that?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm pretty sure this has to be something with the <strong>spread operator</strong> (*).

Circular Dependency (Voronoi Halfedge) <p>I know, \circular dependency is a bad design\, but I think in this case it's warranted.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>When building a voronoi diagram, the cells are divided into what are called \half edges\, this allows you to traverse the diagram in handy ways.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Anyway, in order to instantiate a halfedge, I have to specify the mirror, or twin of the halfedge.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is funky in any language, but in Kotlin it's even more annoying because I have to use a nullable var instead of a val, like I would prefer.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Right now I'm doing this funkiness, which I don't like;</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>//elsewhere</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>A halfedge mirror can never be null, and should be immutable, but I don't see how to communicate that intention in my code.</p>&#xA;

Java annotation processor - Annotated Kotlin classes unit tests <p>I have an annotation processor <a href=\https://github.com/LachlanMcKee/gsonpath\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>library</a> that I would like to get working for Kotlin, however I have hit a snag in terms of my unit testing. I would really appreciate if someone could give me some advice.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My current unit testing implementation uses Google's <a href=\https://github.com/google/compile-testing\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>compile-testing</a> library. I create input and output classes and store them in the resources directory.

However when I attempt to write some tests using Kotlin classes, my test fails to load the class.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I believe this is due to the compile-testing library being first and foremost a Java specific library (I don't see any mention of Kotlin on their project)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>At the moment I get the following issue:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The problem is fairly obvious that the incorrect compiler is being used. The exception itself is thrown when my file extension is not '.java'. If I attempt to load a Kotlin class with the '.java' file extension, it doesn't work since it is not correct Java syntax.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Has anyone come across this issue before and solved it?

However, I am writing most, if not all of my code, in Kotlin.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Kotlin already offers <a href=\https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>great Java interop</a>, so using the generated sources is not a problem. However, because of how Kotlin <a href=\https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html#null-safety-and-platform-types\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>brings Java's nullable types into a null-safe system</a>, I lose most of the null-safety that I use Kotlin for. At the very best I have warnings of platform types (make type explicit to avoid subtle bugs); at the worst I have unexpected crashes and subtle bugs.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Kotlin does, however, respect <a href=\https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html#nullability-annotations\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>nullability annotations</a>, such as JSR-305, FindBugs, Lombok, Eclipse, and JetBrains's respective forms of /, bringing those in as the appropriate non-null type or optional.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Because the code is generated and I have access to the source (and understand how it works), I know which functions can/not return , and want to annotate them as such so they include neatly into my null-safe code.

nullPointerException on sharedpreferences helper class When running a test <p>I'm starting to use kotlin on a little demo android app. I've created a sharedpreferences helper class which i'm trying to test with junit and mockito.  below is my sharedprefshelper </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>here is my test class</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>issue is when i call addPrefsValueString() in the helper. the line</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>edit!!.putString(key, value).commit()</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>throws a null pointer exception? not sure why? ive setup the mock sharedprefs and  sharedpreferences.Edit in the test class method annotated with @Before (shown below)</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>i'm sure my code is less than optimal.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>EDIT:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>heres my fix for the testItemAdded() method. need to return the mock preferences editor on the first call. </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;

IntelliJ imports Java Boolean and then throws error <p>(First of all, yes, Minecraft plugin development.

Indeed, it's as simple as removing the import, but that's extra effort for nothing, as it should be able to do this itself. It may have something to do with extending a Java class, which has methods returning a Java Boolean, but I don't see how this would be the case, as it's simply way too annoying and more users should have noted it before.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If I change the return type to  it says the overridden class, with no connection whatsoever to Kotlin STD-Lib, uses the Kotlin version and that I should change it to .

Kotlin: isAssignableFrom and reflection type checks <p>In Kotlin (1.0.6), through reflection I need to iterate over the members of a class (let's call it ), and do something based on the return type.

Spring Boot 2 and Kotlin (with Maven) <p>I want to start a new project using Spring Boot 2 (that’s build snapshots for the time being), which in turn uses Spring Framework 5 (bleeding edge as well). Reason is that Spring 5 is supposed to have <a href=\https://spring.io/blog/2017/01/04/introducing-kotlin-support-in-spring-framework-5-0\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>much improved Kotlin support</a>, and I would like to use Kotlin.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now the <a href=\https://github.com/sdeleuze/spring-boot-kotlin-demo\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>example</a> that I find use Spring Boot 1.4.3, and of course Gradle, and of course Kotlin-based Gradle file. To be honest, this is too much new technology for me for a single project. I don’t even know how to add a new repository to the Gradle (Kotlin-Gradle!) build script. I would prefer a Maven project, since I’m familiar with that at least, and brand-new Spring and Kotlin will be enough experimentation.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, how to do this in Maven?

What advantages does kotlin offer for XML templating <p>I'm generating several hundreds XML files. The schema is known and there are about 5-10 different schemas governing all files.

MVP + RxJava - Put the Schedulers in the Presenter or in the Interactor? <p>I am developing an Android application with MVP and RxJava.

Firebase: clean way for using enum fields in Kotlin/Java? <p>My data on firebase uses many fields which have string type, but really are enum values (which I check in my validation rules).

I know I can work around this with a second (excluded) field which is an enum, and set this basing on the string value. A short example:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now, while this works, it's not really clean:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>The  itself is (1) kinda long for an&#xA;enum, (2) the insides are repeated for every enum. And I have more of them.</li>&#xA;<li>It's not only enums, the  field above is really a timestamp,&#xA;not a .</li>&#xA;<li>Each model uses these enum fields a lot of times, which bloats the model classes with repeatable code...</li>&#xA;<li>The helper field/functions are getting much worse/longer for fields with types such as ...</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, is there any way to do this properly? Some library maybe? Or some way to write a magic \field wrapper\ that would automatically convert strings to enums, or numbers to timestamps, and so on, but is still compatible with Firebase library for getting/setting data?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>(Java solutions are welcome too :) )</p>&#xA;

Big compilation time for Kotlin code in IntelliJ <p>I have used Kotlin with latest version of <strong>Eclipse</strong> for 2 months without any performance problem on my <strong>Windows 10</strong> computer.&#xA;Now I would like to do a live coding session about Kotlin with <strong>intelliJ</strong> (since it's the JetBrains language...) ultimate edition that I just installed and never used before, on a recent <strong>OSX</strong> computer. The two computers have good hardware and are no limiting my tests.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My problem is that each time there is a modification in my Kotlin code, the compilation time is between <strong>8 seconds</strong> and <strong>35 seconds</strong>. I did my tests on minimalist code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>If I change the variable \a\ and so need to build again, it always need 8 seconds in the best cases to complete the compilation.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Since I want to do a live coding session with a lot of small functions and compilations, this kind of delay is way too much significative.&#xA;The viewers will need to wait a lot before to see the results at each compilation, they are logically expecting good performance from IntelliJ tool.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In the same project, I tried to do the same kind of <strong>Java class</strong> (with a single attribute) and modify its attribute in order to trigger the compilation, and it takes less than <strong>1 second</strong> to compile.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I tried to <strong>manually compile the code in command line</strong> with that:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I had some decent compilation times, even if it was near to <strong>3 seconds</strong>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>When I look at the \Messages\ screen in IntelliJ while it is compiling Kotlin code, I can see this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>It stops here for all the compilation time, and then do almost instantaneously the next steps:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Maybe there is a problem in the configuration of IntelliJ or something like this. I had a hard time at searching for something that could improve the performances but nothing helped me...</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I would be very grateful if someone can help me to have some realistic compilation time with Kotlin in Intellij like in Eclipse!</p>&#xA;

Spring Boot Application: File System Watcher for Many Paths <p>I'm working on a Spring Boot application in Kotlin.  One of the requirements is to load a list of paths from a database and monitor those files for changes.  These paths may be individual files, folder, or both.  The real issue will be the volume as this may require watching quite a few paths in disparate locations (1,000's ?).  The files will be local paths (though I suppose it would be possible to map/mount a network file system, but not supported), so that may help things.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I've been looking at the FileSystemWatcher in Spring Boot as well as the WatchService in Java, but they seem to be more focused on watching a single directory (with an optional filter).  Is there any better solution in both ease of adding many paths to a single watch event handler and performance across many watches?  If not, which would be my best bet?  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm also thinking about pulling this out as a micro-service, so Spring Boot is not necessarily required, just an easy option.  Mostly the requirement is just that it is written in Kotlin (though I could get away with some other JVM language if it will reduce the work).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks!</p>&#xA;

Can't serve dynamic Web Content with Spring Boot and Kotlin <p>Based on a Spring Boot <a href=\https://spring.io/guides/gs/serving-web-content/\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>tutorial</a> to served dynamic web content, I wanted to do the same in Kotlin.

Kotlin list to EnumMap with sums <p>I have to migrate my project to Kotlin.

Realm returning stale data <p>I don't have a lot of experience writing Android apps. For fun I am writing an app that will upload my call logs to my server. This entire app is running as a Service. The Service (starts when the phone is booted) is the one that registers the ContentObserver, which then calls my custom  class. I use  to listen for content change events. Unfortunately, the ContentObserver is called multiple times when I e.g. dial a number. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For that reason, I have function that I call after a successful upload (I use Retrofit) called . This function creates a  called  (which is different from my regular  model). This  simply has one identifier which is the  of the call, which should be unique enough. Then, when I am iterating through the list of all the call logs, I check every single call log against a  function, which does a Realm query and checks to see if there is already a call log with that dateTime stored in the database (realm). In theory, it should work.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, I have noticed that it does not always work. It seems that very often my data is stale. When I do , it returns false (although I swear it returned true once). In my  function, even when I do a  on the Realm, I do not see all of my data - but the data definitely did hit the  function.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here's my code - it's in Kotlin but should be easy to understand:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I am very new to Realm and fairly new to Android development, so I would appreciate any help you can give me. Thanks!</p>&#xA;

Using both publishOn and subscribeOn on a flux results in nothing happening <p>Whenever i use both subscribeOn and publishOn nothing is printed.&#xA;   If I use only one it will print.&#xA;   If I use subscribeOn(Schedulers.immediate()) or elastic it works.&#xA;   Any ideea why that is?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It was my understanding that publishOn affects on what thread it gets published and subscribe on on what thread the subscriber runs.

Adding secondary constructor to parent unexpectedly affects child classes <p>I have a (seemingly) odd problem. It can be reproduced with just a few lines:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>It compiles and works as expected as long as I keep 's secondary constructor commented out.&#xA;Once I put it back in, this lint error pops up where the 's parent constuctor is called:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The error goes away if any of these is true:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>I specify variance as ,</li>&#xA;<li>My secondary constructor is empty,</li>&#xA;<li> is declared as  instead of  (which I don't do because for my purposes I need it to implement ).</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>To be honest, it doesn't make much sense to me. Why does it happen only if I add non-empty secondary constructor to the parent class? What does it have to do with anything? And how exactly do these \fixes\ fix it?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks.</p>&#xA;

How to initialize a var in a lambda <p>I keep bumping into situations like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The issue is, I think, that Kotlin has no idea when the lambda passed to  will be called so it can't know if the variable was initialized by the time you get to .

How can I explicitly signal completion of a Flowable in RxJava? <p>I'm trying to create a  which is wrapping an . I push elements to my  periodically but it seems that the <strong>completion</strong> event is implicit. I don't know how to signal that processing is complete. For example in my code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This prints:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I checked the source of the  interface but it seems that I can't signal that a  is complete explicitly. How can I do so? In my program I publish events which have some delay between them and I would like to be explicit when to  the event flow.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Clarification</strong>:&#xA;I have a long running process which emits events. I gather them in a queue and I expose a method which returns a Flowable which wraps around my queue. The problem is that there might be already elements in the queue when I create the Flowable. I will process the events only once and I know when the flow of events stops so I know when I need to complete the Flowable.</p>&#xA;

Kotlin : safe lambdas (no memory leak)? <p>After having read <a href=\https://medium.com/freenet-engineering/memory-leaks-in-android-identify-treat-and-avoid-d0b1233acc8#.yet4778q1\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>this article about Memory Leaks</a>, I am wondering whether using lambdas in Kotlin Android project is safe. It's true that lambda syntax makes me program with more ease, but what about the Memory Leaks ?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>As an example of the problematic, I've taken a piece of code from one of my projects, where I build an AlertDialog. This code is inside the MainActivity class of my project.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>My question is very simple : can the two lambdas set for positive and negative buttons lead to Memory Leaks ?

Kotlin local variable thread safety <p>So I was writing a unit test to test some multi-threading, and I want to know if this code is guaranteed to work as I would expect.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Specifically, is this method guaranteed to complete?  and  aren't  so does that mean the results set in those values from the  threads might never be seen by the thread running the test?

Kotlin extensions/synthetic properties: same object in multiple invocations of Fragment.onViewCreated() <p>I am using kotlin-android-extensions to import synthetic view properties from my layout to my Fragment. In my  Fragment method I am calling  on an  view that is a synthetic import. This is working fine the first time the Fragment is instantiated, but the next time it comes along, my new listener is being added to the <em>same</em> view object as the last invocation. So now both  objects are being triggered on text changes, with predictably poor results. The view from the first appearance of the Fragment is never dereferenced as far as I can tell.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here's my output from logging the view object which shows it's the same thing.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>First appearance:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Second appearance:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Of course, I can work around this issue by using  to access my view instead of the synthetic reference, but I'm wondering if anyone else is running in to this issue and if there is a better way to handle it (other than not using the synthetic view reference.)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>FYI: Using Kotlin version <strong>1.0.6</strong>.</p>&#xA;

Kotlin function parameter: Val cannot be reassigned <p>I have written Red–black tree in Kotlin.

An implementing Presenter may be supplied a subclass of BaseView, eg , which means that BaseView is not specific enough.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>However I still need to tell the presenter what its view is by passing a reference to the implementing activity. Ideally I can do all of this from the Base classes so that the MVP implementation details are almost invisible to implementing classes.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have found two ways to do this, but they have their problems:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>1. I could make each implementing activity override a  field, but every single implementing activity would have the same identical line of code!  Boilerplate much?  It also doesn't seem in the spirit of generics.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>2. I could just assume that  is always a  and ignore the lint error.  However this is dangerous and again is not in the spirit of generics.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there a sexy way of doing all this in Kotlin?  Some sort of constraint that all classes extending BaseActivity have to implement some kind of BaseView for instance?</p>&#xA;

Kotlin compiler not found using Gradle plugin <p>I'm trying to upgrade some Gradle projects from Kotlin 1.0.6 to its latest version (1.1.0). However, whenever it reaches the  task it fails:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The project itself is divided in a bunch of subprojects. To avoid dupes, we have a separate file with the Kotlin definitions and import it on the projects using it:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>File:</strong> gradle/kotlin.gradle</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And we import it in the subprojects like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Since we previously tried the early preview releases and it worked seamlessly, I changed the version a couple times to see in which version the plugin broke. It turns out it works up to 1.1-M03; beginning at 1.1-M04 it shows the exact same error as in the 1.1.0 release.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We're using Gradle 2.10 in the project. Can you help me figure out whether it is a problem in our configuration? or a known issue with the Kotlin plugin itself?</p>&#xA;

Java methods wrongly get automatically overloaded in kotlin <p>Given a Java library containing the following (condensed) class:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Since kotlin automagically converts suitable method names into overloaded operators, I can write</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>...with the completely unexpected result that  gets mutated by the infix division operation. And, furthermore, that the reference stored in  points to the same object as  Output:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Since the library also provides an overload to write the result into another vector, I was wondering if I can 'tell' kotlin not to use the provided  method.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have already tried to provide an extension method to  but that gets shadowed by the real member:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;
Kotlin: How are a Delegate's get- and setValue Methods accessed? <p><br>I've been wondering how <a href=\https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/delegated-properties.html\ rel=\noreferrer\>delegated properties</a> (\by\-Keyword) work under-the-hood.<br> I get that by contract the delegate (right side of \by\) has to implement a get and setValue(...) method, but how can that be ensured by the compiler and how can those methods be accessed at runtime?<br> My initial thought was that obviously the delegates must me implementing some sort of \SuperDelegate\-Interface, but it appears that is not the case.<br> So the only option left (that I am aware of) would be to use Reflection to access those methods, possibly implemented at a low level inside the language itself. I find that to be somewhat weird, since by my understanding that would be rather inefficient. Also the Reflection API is not even part of the stdlib, which makes it even weirder.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I am assuming that the latter is already (part of) the answer. So let me furthermore ask you the following: Why is there no SuperDelegate-Interface that declare the getter and setter methods that we are forced to use anyway? Wouldn't that be much cleaner?&#xA;<br><br></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><em>The following is not essential to the question</em></p>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The described Interface(s) are even already defined in <a href=\https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.properties/-read-only-property/\ rel=\noreferrer\>ReadOnlyProperty</a> and <a href=\https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.properties/-read-write-property/index.html\ rel=\noreferrer\>ReadWriteProperty</a>. To decide which one to use could then be made dependable on whether we have a val/var. Or even omit that since calling the setValue Method on val's is being prevented by the compiler and only use the ReadWriteProperty-Interface as the SuperDelegate.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Arguably when requiring a delegate to implement a certain interface the construct would be less flexible. Though that would be assuming that the Class used as a Delegate is possibly unaware of being used as such, which I find to be unlikely given the specific requirements for the necessary methods. And if you still insist, here's a crazy thought: Why not even go as far as to make that class implement the required interface via <a href=\https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html\ rel=\noreferrer\>Extension</a> (I'm aware that's not possible as of now, but heck, why not? Probably there's a good 'why not', please let me know as a side-note).</p>&#xA;

firebase db: models with Kotlin delegated properties <p>I'm using Kotlin objects to work with my Firebase Database models, as described <a href=\https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/android/read-and-write#basic_write\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>in the guide</a>. I have many fields that are stored as strings, but really are enums, so to be type-safe I have enum fields in the models, plus a string delegated property that returns the firebase stored value (as suggested in <a href=\https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41651507/firebase-clean-way-for-using-enum-fields-in-kotlin-java\>a question I asked</a> some time ago). Now, these fields work if I get/set the string delegate in code, but firebase libs seem to skip them when converting to/from database's json format.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>A simple example:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The  always gives a  error, but works, if I delete  field and make  a normal  property.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It's similar for reading: Firebase gives no errors when getting a Weight object, but the  field is never set to anything else than the default. But, if I manually do , the  field properly returns .</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm using firebase libs v10.0.1</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now, the questions:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>What can I do to make the delegated properties work correctly with firebase? I can try a different approach to the delegated enum fields, as long as the points from <a href=\https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41651507/firebase-clean-way-for-using-enum-fields-in-kotlin-java\>my original question</a> are satisfied (readable, concise and type-safe code).</li>&#xA;<li>is there any way to see how <strong>exactly</strong> do firebase libs convert objects to/from json? Or at least see the converted json? Maybe then I could tweak things myself. Unfortunately, everything firebase-related shows as  in AndroidStudio.</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: I could of course add a  method to each model, where I would construct a map containing all the properties needed in firebase, but it would be tiresome to do this for every model, and it solves the saving issue only, the enum fields still wouldn't be set when getting.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The delegated props are also skipped when serializing with GSON. So maybe is there a generic way to make the delegated properties look like regular fields?</p>&#xA;

Why do I need a repository and a service + contract <p>I'm new to Spring coming from PHP/Larvel, Ruby/Rails and Python/Django.

From what I read on Spring guides on Repositories you already get the default  methods  on top of that you also have query methods where you can do  or write annotated raw queries.

Kotlin raw string throws blank error <p>I'm creating a gradle plugin using kotlin and I am inserting some ascii art.

How does erasure work in Kotlin? <p>In Kotlin, the following code compiles:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This code, however, does not: </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Compiling this will cause the following error:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>In Java, neither example will compile: </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Unsurprisingly, both of the prior snippets generate the familiar compiler error:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>What surprises me is that the first Kotlin example works at all, and second, if it works, why does the second Kotlin example fail? Does Kotlin consider a method's return type as part of its signature? Furthermore, why do method signatures in Kotlin respect the full parameter type, in contrast with Java?</p>&#xA;

After that the presenter tells the view to do whatever is needed according to the callback.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here's the test code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>That's the tested code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And the test fails with this error message:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>java.lang.IllegalStateException: any(CategoriesRepository…riesListener::class.java) must not be null&#xA;&#xA;at com.boyukliev.verseattack.ui.categories.CategoriesActivityPresenterTest.shouldPassCategoriesToView2(CategoriesActivityPresenterTest.kt:60)&#xA;at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)&#xA;at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62)&#xA;at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)&#xA;at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:498)&#xA;at org.junit.runners.model.FrameworkMethod$1.runReflectiveCall(FrameworkMethod.java:50)&#xA;at org.junit.internal.runners.model.ReflectiveCallable.run(ReflectiveCallable.java:12)&#xA;at org.junit.runners.model.FrameworkMethod.invokeExplosively(FrameworkMethod.java:47)&#xA;at org.junit.internal.runners.statements.InvokeMethod.evaluate(InvokeMethod.java:17)&#xA;at org.junit.internal.runners.statements.RunBefores.evaluate(RunBefores.java:26)&#xA;at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.runLeaf(ParentRunner.java:325)&#xA;at org.junit.runners.BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.runChild(BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.java:78)&#xA;at org.junit.runners.BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.runChild(BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.java:57)&#xA;at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$3.run(ParentRunner.java:290)&#xA;at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$1.schedule(ParentRunner.java:71)&#xA;at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.runChildren(ParentRunner.java:288)&#xA;at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.access$000(ParentRunner.java:58)&#xA;at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$2.evaluate(ParentRunner.java:268)&#xA;at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.run(ParentRunner.java:363)&#xA;at org.mockito.internal.runners.DefaultInternalRunner$1.run(DefaultInternalRunner.java:68)&#xA;at org.mockito.internal.runners.DefaultInternalRunner.run(DefaultInternalRunner.java:74)&#xA;at org.mockito.internal.runners.StrictRunner.run(StrictRunner.java:39)&#xA;at org.mockito.junit.MockitoJUnitRunner.run(MockitoJUnitRunner.java:161)&#xA;at org.junit.runner.JUnitCore.run(JUnitCore.java:137)&#xA;at com.intellij.junit4.JUnit4IdeaTestRunner.startRunnerWithArgs(JUnit4IdeaTestRunner.java:117)&#xA;at com.intellij.junit4.JUnit4IdeaTestRunner.startRunnerWithArgs(JUnit4IdeaTestRunner.java:42)&#xA;at com.intellij.rt.execution.junit.JUnitStarter.prepareStreamsAndStart(JUnitStarter.java:262)&#xA;at com.intellij.rt.execution.junit.JUnitStarter.main(JUnitStarter.java:84)&#xA;at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)&#xA;at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62)&#xA;at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)&#xA;at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:498)&#xA;at com.intellij.rt.execution.application.AppMain.main(AppMain.java:147)&#xA;&#xA;org.mockito.exceptions.misusing.InvalidUseOfMatchersException: &#xA;Misplaced or misused argument matcher detected here:&#xA;&#xA;-&gt; at com.boyukliev.verseattack.ui.categories.CategoriesActivityPresenterTest.shouldPassCategoriesTo
Multiple constructors on an immutable (data) class <p>I'm trying to implement an immutable data class with more than one constructor. I felt that something like this should be possible:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Of course, it isn't: Kotlin expects the call to the main constructor be declared at the top:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>That's no good either, as the call is executed <em>before</em> the constructor body and can not access the local variables.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I can do <em>this</em>, of course:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But this will check the assertion too late, and does not scale very well.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The only way I see to get close to the desired behaviour is this using a  helper function (which can't be defined non-static on ):</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This does not strike me as a very elegant pattern, so I'm guessing I'm missing something here.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there an elegant, idiomatic way to have (complex) secondary constructors on immutable data classes in Kotlin?</p>&#xA;
Companion objects hide class -- bug or feature? <p>In Kotlin, the following seems to be reasonable code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, it does not compile: type  binds to  instead of !</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is that a (language design or compiler) bug, or is this a feature? If the latter, what is the idiomatic way to implement  in the presence of a companion object?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Of course, there is what I would consider a workaround:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But that isn't too nice, now is it?</p>&#xA;
How should I set up mutable test fixtures in Spek? <p>I'm trying to get my head around fixtures in Spek. <a href=\http://spekframework.org/docs/latest/#_basic_structure\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>The Calculator example in the docs</a> is easy to follow, but I'm not sure how to go about structuring setup/teardown when some of the fixtures are stateful. For example, if I was testing a list:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>From what I understand, in Spek the  block is only evaluated once, so there is only ever one instance of List. The docs helpfully suggest using test fixtures, but then <em>unhelpfully</em> fail to give an example!</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I assume the following doesn't work because Kotlin doesn't understand that Spek will definitely call  before </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I can get around that by making the variable nullable, but then I have to use nullsafe operators everywhere, which sucks because I know it's never null:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This also works, but means that every bit of setup code now needs to be duplicated in two places</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Excuse me if any of this is obvious, but I'm coming from JUnit world where absolutely everything (bar statics) is torn down and rebuilt before every test, so this all seems rather alien!</p>&#xA;
Singleton database object with parameterized initialization on startup? <p>I'm attempting to create a single database instance that can be used by multiple classes (using  keyword in Kotlin). However, I wanted to be able to specify the database name before the singleton instance is created.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Since a singleton object cannot be initialized with a parameter, I was wondering if what I'm doing is valid, or if there's a better way of doing things:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And in another file</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Basically, I'm encapsulating a \database container\ in the singleton object by using lazy initialization for the database container and providing lateinit vars for specifying the database name and having an initialization function in the singleton object to initialize the database container. This is so that in my main method when I first start up my application, I can load the database name from some local properties file and call  to create my database singleton that needs to be accessed by multiple other classes.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is this a good approach to do what I want, or are there better ways of doing things?</p>&#xA;

Kotlin anonymous function use case? <p>Based on my understanding, anonymous function in Kotlin allow you to specify return type.

kotlin: Generic to different types <p>I need linear functions like this: </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Then, I need the same thing for vectors. </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>As you can see, the two Linear classes are identical (except for argument types). Now, I can not make the class generic, as Double and Vector3d do not have a common superclass. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If I want to write Linear just once, my only option is my own Double-type, which than has a common interface with Vector3d. However, this means I can not use 0 in the source code any longer, but I have to use MyDouble(0) everywhere. I could overload the constructor of Linear to accept Doubles, and create the MyDouble objects internally, however, I would need to do this for every single method in my API. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there a better solution? </p>&#xA;

Implement only one method from interface in anonymous class <p>Is it possible in Kotlin to create an anonymous class implementing a certain interface and only implement the functions you'll need?

HTTP headers not returned on EC2 <p>I have a Spring Boot application deployed on 2 EC2 instances (staging and production environments). I have an endpoint that is used for downloading a file. It looks like this (the app is written in Kotlin):</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>When I execute a download request on the staging machine everything is fine. I get back the file and the response has the headers set. These are the headers that I can see in Postman:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>When I do the same request on production, the response body contains the file content, but the 2 headers that I set manually, \Content-Type\ and \Content-Disposition\, are missing:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Both machines have the exact same JAR deployed in a Docker container. Both calls are done directly against the EC2 instances, using their private IPs, so no ELB is involved. The configuration of the 2 instances is identical, with no differences that I could find in the AWS Console.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Do you know what might cause this? Is there a setting in EC2 that can prevent some HTTP headers for being sent back in responses? I cannot find any reason for why the headers are sent back in one case and not in the other.</p>&#xA;

Kotlin, table/array based on entries with dynamic fields <p>I am doing a <a href=\https://github.com/kotlin-graphics/gli\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>kotlin port</a> of <a href=\https://github.com/g-truc/gli\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>g-truc gli</a> and I am actually considering a slight design change.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Gli uses an internal rapresentation of texture format, types, swizzles, etc ( and so on).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In this <a href=\https://github.com/g-truc/gli/blob/master/test/core/gl.cpp#L10-L13\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>test</a>, it instantiates the GL struct, passing the profile and then reads the translated gli format:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The  will fetch from a <a href=\https://github.com/g-truc/gli/blob/master/gli/core/gl.inl#L58\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>table</a> and the profile, you pass in the constructor, is needed because some of the entry fields in that table are <a href=\https://github.com/g-truc/gli/blob/master/gli/core/gl.inl#L32-L54\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>profile-dependant</a>:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Each entry in that table is the following <a href=\https://github.com/g-truc/gli/blob/master/gli/gl.hpp#L353-L359\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>struct</a>:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>At the moment I implemented essentially the same, a <a href=\https://github.com/kotlin-graphics/gli/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/gli/GL.kt#L20\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>GL class</a> which at the instatiation will initialize <a href=\https://github.com/kotlin-graphics/gli/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/gli/GL.kt#L18\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\></a>:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And my  is made of <a href=\https://github.com/kotlin-graphics/gli/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/gli/GL.kt#L331\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\> classes</a>:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But I'd like to avoid instance design if possible, because usually I am going to use the instance just for the texture creation and nothing else. Also, in this way I'd avoid creating a new class.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So I thought about one possible alternative solution and I came up using lambdas and a dynamic table, with lambda-based entries. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'd replace the  with an , then set the  first and then the next  call will fetch from the table and execute the lambda.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In this way my  would change in</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Since most of the entry fields are static, that is for example:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I could write additional constructors that received plain values instead lambdas to avoid wrapping everything in , but that's it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is this a good way to implement a table based on dynamic entries or is there a better/simpler solution for that?</p>&#xA;

IntelliJ and Android Studio icons for Kotlin files <p>I have been tinkering trying to understand what IntelliJ (and Android Studio) are doing to my Kotlin file icons.  In the picture you can see that Kotlin files come with two different icons - either a rectangle with a small \K\ or a circled C with a small \K\ (circled in red in the picture).   The rectangle version also includes a useful \.kt\ suffix.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>After some tinkering with this black box of a problem - it appears that if the kotlin file <em>just</em> declares a class matching the file name then it gets a \circled C\ icon.   But if it does anything that is un-Java-like - such as declaring a variable outside the class (e.g. ) - then the icon is shifted to the rectangle with the \K\.  The icon documentation <a href=\http://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2017.1/file-types-recognized-by-intellij-idea.html\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>here</a> suggests that IntelliJ thinks the rectangle with the \K\ is a \Kotlin file\ whereas the circled C is a \Kotlin class\.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Does anybody know if there is a deeper meaning to this?   I think I will include a  declaration outside the class just to get my Kotlin file icon symbols all to match.   Then they will also have the handy \.kt\ extension to clearly indicate that they are Kotlin files.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example - here is code that will change your icon to a rectangle with a \K\ in file Foo.kt:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href=\https://i.stack.imgur.com/CTvCP.png\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\><img src=\https://i.stack.imgur.com/CTvCP.png\ alt=\enter image description here\></a></p>&#xA;

If I click on a link that takes me to the browser, add/send a contact person from my App to the contact list on the phone or share via Gmail, Google+, bluetooth, etc. the error occurs. So what happens is that on all of these issues I have to exit the app(press the homebutton) or open another application from the app (contacts, gmail, etc.) and the app crashes.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I can also mention that when I add a person from my app to the phones contact list all the information gets sent, and I am able to add the person. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Does anyone have any clue why this happonds? Feel free to ask me for more details if that is necessary, I have had this bug for a while now and it is very irritating. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Entire error:</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;

Enabling Spring Security global method security breaks dependency injection (with Kotlin) <p>I am currently working on the authentication system for a Spring Boot application, and I've been having issues since I tried to enable Spring Security's global method security.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The Spring Boot application being a REST API, the authentication system is a bit non-standard, so I have set up a custom authentication filter that I add to the  object that pre-processes the request, calls a custom  and gives the final  object to the .

Kotlin: Construct value of derived generic type in base class <p>I'm trying to reduce duplication across some vector types by defining the operators once, but I'm not sure it's possible.

Mixing class and function generics in Kotlin? <p>I'm trying to create an interface that defines a single method.

Efficient map and filter combination vs stdlibs <p>I'm trying to write an efficient solution to a common map/filter paradigm. In Kotlin, you can write code that looks like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Generically, I'm applying a map, then filtering the mapped values based on a condition. However, an intermediate collection is created for this. This seems unnecessary. I wrote a little function that should do the same thing, but without the intermediate collection.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, IntelliJ is suggesting a stdlib replacement for my function that would make it look like:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Which turns my optimization straight back into the original code I wrote and re-introduces the inefficiency of creating multiple collections.

Kotlin: ProGuard erases properties attributes <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: with proguard enabled, when using reflection, my properties look private, non-nullable and without annotations, despite proguard config that should keep all these attributes.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have some simple es with public properties to serve as data models in my Android app. Later, when doing generic [de]serialization of said classes, I filter the property list like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>It works normally on my debug builds (I mean it selects the properties I want it to). But, when doing a <strong>release</strong> build, where proguard is active, <strong>the result is empty</strong>. To check why, I logged all the relevant stuff about the properties of one class -- turns out their  field reads  (and all other attributes remain the same as on a debug build).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I already have a line in proguard config to keep all the models:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I tried this one before, with same result:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Why/how does proguard affect property visibility? Should I modify the config somehow? Or am I missing something else here? </p>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: It seems like visibility is not the only thing.  also doesn't work, it returns  for properties declared nullable.

Generics on KProperty1.getDelegate too restrictive? <p>I am trying to obtain all property delegates of a certain type in a class hierarchy. This is presenting me with some issues.&#xA;For a start, there seems to be no straightforward way to obtain a class' superclass in Kotlin. The first way I tried was to use Java's :</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But this requires an unchecked cast, because Kotlin will not allow me to convert a  back to Kotlin, because apparently in T means it could be something that is not Any, whatever that might be (\Type parameter has an upper bound 'Any' that cannot be satisfied capturing 'in' projection\).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So I tried a pure Kotlin solution: First get all superclasses including interfaces () and then filter out every interface. But there is nothing on  that tells me if it's an interface! So I have to go to Java for that again. And it again requires an unchecked cast, because for some reason  is of type  and not :</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Am I missing something here? I must be.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now for the actual question, trying to obtain all property delegate instances in a class hierarchy. First I wrote a function to obtain the instances for one class:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Works fine. But of course I also need all the properties declared in superclasses. So naturally I tried to change the receiver to  which of course results in me not being able to call  anymore. How do I solve this?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I already tried using , but it falls short if a subclass overrides a property which is delegated in a parent class. In that case it will only list the overridden property, which does not allow me to access the property delegate instance.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Edit:</strong>&#xA;I did some more testing, and the following Java code compiles just fine, as I would expect:&#xA;</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>What would be the equivalent Kotlin code?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Edit²:</strong>&#xA;Same for the super-class stuff.

Boilerplate project configuration in Gradle with Gradle Script Kotlin <p>I'm currently trying to improve the way our projects share their configuration. We have lots of different multi-module gradle projects for all of our libraries and microservices (i.e. many git repos). </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My main goals are:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>To not have my Nexus repository URL duplicated in every project (also, I can safely assume that it won't change)</li>&#xA;<li>To make my custom Gradle plugins available to every project with minimal boilerplate / duplication (they should be available to every project, and the only thing the project cares about is the version it's using)</li>&#xA;<li>No magic - it should be obvious to developers how everything is configured</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My current solution is a custom gradle distribution with an init script that:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>adds  and our Nexus repository to the project repos (very similar to the Gradle <a href=\https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/init_scripts.html#sec:init_script_plugins\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>init script documentation example</a>, except it adds repos as well as validating them)</li>&#xA;<li>configures an extension that allows our gradle plugins to be added to the buildscript classpath (using <a href=\https://discuss.gradle.org/t/how-can-you-use-an-init-script-to-specify-a-repo-dependency-for-a-plugin-jar-but-allow-version-to-be-configured-in-builds-root-project/5416/4\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>this workaround</a>). It also adds our Nexus repo as a buildscript repo as that's where the plugins are hosted. We have quite a few plugins (built upon Netflix's excellent <a href=\https://github.com/nebula-plugins\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>nebula plugins</a>) for various boilerplate: standard project setup (kotlin setup, test setup, etc), releasing, publishing, documentation, etc and it means our project  files are pretty much just for dependencies.</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>While this approach works, allows reproducible builds (unlike our previous setup which applied a build script from a URL), and allows working offline, it does make it a little magical and I was wondering if I could do things better. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This was all triggered by reading a comment recently by a gradle dev on github (I'm not sure where) stating that a build should work without relying on an init script, i.e. implying that init scripts should just do things like the documented example - preventing unauthorised repos, etc.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My idea was to write some extension functions that would allow me to add our Nexus repo and plugins to a build in a way that looked like they were built into gradle (similar to the extension functions  and  provided by gradle script kotlin)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So I created my extension functions in a kotlin gradle project:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>With the plan to use them in my project's  as follows:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, Gradle was unable to see my functions when used in the  block (unable to compile script). Using them in the normal project repos/dependencies worked fine though (they are visible and work as expected). </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If this worked, I was hoping to bundle the jar into my custom distribution , meaning my init script could just do simple validation instead of hiding away the magical plugin and repo configuration. The extension functions wouldn't need to change, so it wouldn't require releasing a new Gradle distribution when plugins change.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What I tried:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>adding my jar to the test project's buildscript classpath (i.e. ) - doesn't work (maybe this doesn't work by design as it doesn't seem right to be adding a dependency to  that's referred to in the same block)</li>&#xA;<li>putting the functions in  (which works for normal project deps/repos but not , but is not a real solution a

Kotlin getter override + MongoDB <p>I'm new to Kotlin development and I cannot figure out how to deal with this issue. I have the following Kotlin data class mapped to a MongoDB collection (Spring Data MongoDB):</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I want to override the default id getter and return a string instead of an ObjectId. It seems that \id\ field name cannot be changed because I'm getting the message \Customizing field name for id property not allowed!

Where is Kotlin's `org.jetbrain.annotations.ReadOnly` annotation provided for Gradle/Maven projects? <p>I have a mixed Kotlin+Java project that is being built using IDEA and am now experimenting with trying to take advantage of Gradle for that project.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In the project, some of the Java code is annotated with Kotlin's  annotation, so that immutable collections are correctly recognized as such from the project's Kotlin code.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>When building in IDEA, the  annotation was coming from . <em>(And if I were building from the command-line it surely would come from either the Kotlin compiler's deprecated  or it's newly unified , both of which provide the annotation the way they're supposed to.)</em></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>When building via Gradle, however, the project depends on </strong>, which in turn depends on , which provides only a subset of the annotations in either the Kotlin compiler's kotlin-stdlib JAR or IDEA's bundled kotlin-runtime JAR. <strong>It doesn't provide the  annotation necessary for instructing Kotlin from Java code that a collection type is immutable.</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>... So, <strong>where is a Gradle/Maven project supposed to be finding this missing part of the Kotlin stdlib?</strong></p>&#xA;

Write call/transaction is dropped in TransactionalEventListener <p>I am using spring-boot(1.4.1) with hibernate(5.0.1.Final). I noticed that when I try to write to the db from within  handler the call is simply ignored. A read call works just fine. &#xA;When I say ignore, I mean there is no write in the db and there are no logs. I even enabled log4jdbc and still no logs which mean no hibernate session was created. From this, I reckon, somewhere in spring-boot we identify that its a transaction event handler and ignore a write call. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here is an example. </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now if I force a new Transaction by annotating </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>a new transaction with connection is made and everything works fine. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li><p>I dont like that there is complete silence in logs when this write is dropped (again reads succeed). Is there a known bug?</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>How to enable the handler to start a new transaction? If I do Propogation.Requires_new on my handleEnqueue event, it does not work. </p></li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Besides, enabling log4jdbc which successfully logs reads/writes I have following settings in spring. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks</p>&#xA;
Kotlin: Interface ... does not have constructors <p>I am converting some of my Java code to Kotlin and I do not quite understand how to instantiate interfaces that are defined in Kotlin code. As an example, I have an interface (defined in Java code):</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And then further in my Kotlin code I instantiate this interface:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>and it works fine. However, when I convert MyInterface to Kotlin:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I get an error message:  when I try to instantiate it - though it seems to me that nothing has changed except syntax. Do I misunderstand how interfaces work in Kotlin?</p>&#xA;

IntelliJ Idea when testing multiple modules at once only artifacts from one module are included <p>I have a project which uses Maven with 3 modules: a parent one, core, and addon. Core has the same artifacts as parent, but addon has an additional one. When I run tests for addon only everything works okay. The problem occurs when I test both modules at once. The tests act as if the addon module didn't have that additional artifact which, causes tests fails. Again, this only occurs when I test both modules at once.

Does Kotlin have an equivalent to Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals in Swift? <p>Implicitly unwrapped optionals are a useful feature of Swift for things like UI elements that are not assigned during a class's constructor, but can be safely be assumed to be non-null for the majority of functions (as they will have been assigned in a viewDidLoad).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>eg.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there an equivalent for Kotlin, or a workaround that achieves the same effect?</p>&#xA;
Kotlin factory interface with generics <p>I have a factory interface in my Kotlin code, like so (using Guava's <a href=\https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/ReflectionExplained#typetoken\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\></a>):</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>So far, so good. This is very easy to use when calling it, however implementation almost always requires an unsafe cast: </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is ugly, but I have overcome it with a nice trick. First, a little utility function for creating  instances:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now I added a companion object to my factory interface:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This allows me to have the unchecked (but safe) cast in one place and I can write code like the following:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>However this approach also falls apart as soon as I want to implement a factory that takes a  and returns a , because there is nowhere for me to put that  parameter.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I am eager to hear your suggestions.</p>&#xA;

Rx-Kotlin awaitTerminalEvent never getting onComplete <p>I am trying to get a better understanding of how to do unit tests with Rx-Kotlin, but I have not been able to successfully set the subject to \completed\.

How to implement finalize() in kotlin? <p>Today I'm implementing a  in kotlin, and as I have done in java in the past, I want to implement a  as a last resort fallback in case the client code forgets to close it, rendering critical resource un-reclaimed. I consider this resource critical enough to add this fallback, despite the unreliability of this fallback. However,  does not declare a  method, which means I can't simplydo this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This isn't good, at least not as good as it should be. Now I revert to plain Java as a workaround. Does anyone knows how to do this in pure Kotlin?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>PS: My current workaround:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>FinalizedCloseable.java:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Kotlin:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But this workaround requires a superclass. If next time my other  already got a superclass, this workaround won't work without a lot of boilerplate.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<p>EDIT: Now I know how to implement finalize(), but IDEA kotlin plugin isn't smart enough to know that this is a finalizer and thus mark it with some warning. After struggling for a while I found how to suppress these warnings, and I want to share it:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;

Why can't type parameter in Kotlin have any other bounds if it's bounded by another type parameter? <p>Here is the minimal demo code that shows this problem:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>When I try to compile it, compiler will complain:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I read <a href=\http://jetbrains.github.io/kotlin-spec/#_bounds\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>Kotlin Language Specification</a>, but only find the following bound restriction:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>It doesn't explain the restriction I meet.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I explore Kotlin's issue tracker, and I find an issue about this restriction: <a href=\https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-13768\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>Allow to inherit a type parameter from another type parameter and a class : KT-13768</a>. However, this issue has been rejected by the following reason (update on May 6th, 2017: this issue has been reopened by Stanislav Erokhin):</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>So the question is: why can't we compile the code correctly to JVM if we remove this restriction?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The same demo works in Scala:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>It indicates that Scala can compile the code correctly to JVM. Why can't Kotlin? Is it a restriction to guarantee a decidable subtyping in Kotlin (I guess. Subtyping is undecidable for Scala (Scala has a Turing-complete type system). Kotlin may want decidable subtyping like C#.)?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Update after answered by @erokhins (<a href=\https://stackoverflow.com/a/43807444/7964561\>https://stackoverflow.com/a/43807444/7964561</a>):</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>There are some subtle issues when supporting something forbidden by Java but allowed by JVM, especially in Java interoperability. I find an interesting issue when digging into bytecode generated by scalac. I modify Scala code in demo as follow:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Scalac will generate the following signature:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Invoke  with  in Scala will succeed, since Scalas invoke signature ; but invoke with  in Java will fail, since Java invokes signature , causing  in runtime. It means scalac generates something cannot be invoked in Java after relaxing this restriction. Kotlin may meet the same issue after relaxing it.</p>&#xA;

Kotlin: Why does the !! operator generate null checks when compiling for the jvm? <p>I am using <a href=\https://javap.yawk.at/\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>https://javap.yawk.at/</a> to inspect Kotlin generated bytecode.

Creating Kotlin classes in Android Studio using intention actions <p>When using Java on Android Studio I must often don't have to create files, I just type the name of the class I want to use and use \Intent Actions\ to solve the problem and create the necessary file. The problem is, when using Kotlin, if I need, lets say an Interface, when I hit the Intent Action, Android Studio creates that Interface in the same file I'm working on, instead of providing a dialog for package selection as it does for Java. Any thoughts on how to fix this?</p>&#xA;

So, in general, can this file be ignored when sharing the project under version control (e.g. Git), i.e., not committing it and publishing it somewhere online? Or should it be ignored?</p>&#xA;
Dynamically evaluating templated Strings in Kotlin <p>Suppose that I have the following piece of Kotlin code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>If I pass in an argument , the output is going to be . As I understand it Kotlin takes care of String templates by generating the code for the output on compilation, presumably using a StringBuilder. Is there some way to evaluate Strings that aren't in the source code with regards to templates in their current context? String templates are very useful and it'd be great to be capable of evaluating expressions that come from a dynamic context, such as configuration files, but as far as I can tell this can't be done.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Lacking that, what would be a good approach towards this? Invoking a scripting engine?</p>&#xA;

Android Studio 3.0 Supporting Kotlin : Activity as Context <p>Since the release of Android Studio 3.0 Canary, I've been trying to learn Kotlin and there is something I cannot understand. &#xA;I was trying to make a simple Activity with a Button and a TextView. &#xA;I cannot understand why Android Studio cannot recognize the activity as a Context.&#xA;In my code I try to make a Toast, but AS gives me in error when i put <strong>this</strong> as the context in the parameter.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The error is : \None of the following functions can be called with the arguments supplied\. And highlight <strong>Context</strong> in red </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here's the code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The thing is that when I run the code I get no flaws, no runtime exception. It's just Android Studio that doesn't recognize this as the context</p>&#xA;
KClass reference for nullable values <p>In Kotlin, when declaring getting a KClass for a type, such as String::class (which represents values whose type will be String), is there a syntax to indicate that the value is nullable (ie represente String? values instead of String).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The context is that I'm trying to generate Kotlin classes using KotlinPoet but all properties I create (with PropertySpec.builder) are not nullable (String for instance, when what I actually want is String?).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks for your help.</p>&#xA;
Mixed Kotlin + Java with Maven, unresolved reference <p>I have a Maven project with Kotlin code  which calls Java code  which calls Kotlin code .  also calls  directly. I'm trying to build this with  using exactly the Maven settings described in <a href=\http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-maven.html#compiling-kotlin-and-java-sources\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>kotlinlang's Maven docs</a>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If  doesn't call  (but I leave  in the project) then this builds just fine. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The docs say that the Kotlin compiler should be invoked before the Java compiler, which suggests to me that all Kotlin code needs to compile before any Java code, i.e. with this setup you can call Kotlin from Java but not vice versa.  However, the docs describe this setup as just \mixed code applications\, not \calling Kotlin from Java\.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In other words, this failure seems consistent with what the docs seem to imply but not with what they directly say -- or I'm just misunderstanding something.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I want to call each language from the other.

Are Kotlin inline functions less expensive than Java anonymous classes? <p>Heads up: I'm writing some of this from memory so I may have some of the concepts incorrect. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Java has the ability to write an anonymous function. This is useful when you have a listener interface for some kind of event. As an example: </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The anonymous listener will be compiled as a class that is called something like . This is an underlying design decision of the Java language. Everything is an object, even anonymous functions. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This becomes an issue when you want to write a more functionally driven code base. The large amount of anonymous classes creates a large class count, which can be a problem on constrained platforms such as Android. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In Kotlin functions are much more first class from a source code point of view. My question is, does Kotlin compile these functions down to byte code more efficiently than Java does with anonymous classes or will I run into the same issues as the large class count in Java? </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks, </p>&#xA;

what is the kotlin idiom for an equivalent to this python iterator <p>The question is, how to create a python like iterator in Kotlin.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Consider this python code that parses string into substrings:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is a play example just to illustrate a python iterator:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Kotlin has iterators and generators, and as I understand it there can only be one per type. My idea is to define a type with a generator and instance that type.

What kotlin version(s) should I use for Android Studio 3.0 Canary 1? <p>I have a medium-sized Kotlin project that uses anko and the kotlin android extensions, specifically the synthetic properties from resource IDs.

Kotlin reflection - creating objects from CSV <p>I have a data class named Member:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I am trying to import a CSV file.

I am looking to create my member objects in this fashion to reduce maintenance overhead as the test scope expands and additional criteria (and Member class fields) are added.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Why am I doing any of this in the manner I am doing? Because I still have much to learn... (So, if you see a better way, please, educate me!)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks!</p>&#xA;

Tornadofx - controlling tableview row object while build <p>My requirement is kinda similar to what Angular provides for HTML web pages.<br>&#xA;Basically when creating a table, you iterate over a list of records to get a record and then we can remove a row based on a if condition. Something like this:  </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Similarly in Tornadofx, if I want to build a tableview, I do this:  </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Seeing the tutorials, I have tried the following but with no luck:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>It would be easy if I could have the row object in tableview and perform operations on it.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Frankly, I haven't clearly understood tornadofx bindings, so I might be missing something basic. </p>&#xA;

Share a Kotlin module with an Android and Desktop project <p>I have a game that I am working on that uses the LibGDX game framework. Currently the platforms I am targeting are Desktop (PC, Mac, Linux) via a platform independent jar and Android.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The project is hosted at <a href=\https://github.com/NoxHarmonium/project-whiplash\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>https://github.com/NoxHarmonium/project-whiplash</a> Feel free to take a look if you need to.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The bulk of the code is in a module called  and is written entirely in Kotlin. This module is linked into both the Desktop and Android projects.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This works fine for Android versions 7.1+ and for desktop. For all other versions of Android I get a pile of  exceptions on anonymous functions such as this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Exception Sample:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It seems to be caused by an incompatibility with the JVM that Kotlin targets by default (1.8) and the JVM level that older versions of Android support (1.6). I could be wrong but this explains why the latest version of Android works as it supports a later version of the JVM.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The solution should be as simple as forcing Kotlin to emit JVM byte code as version 1.6 but I can't seem to work it out. If you compile Kotlin directly into an Android, this seems to be handled by using the  Gradle plugin. Unfortunately I can't use this plugin for the core module because it should not have any Android dependencies.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I tried to override the JVM version using the build settings mentioned at <a href=\https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-gradle.html#compiler-options\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-gradle.html#compiler-options</a> like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, it did not seem to work no matter which Gradle file I placed it in. In fact I get a \Cannot resolve symbol 'kotlinOptions'\ error shown by Intellij when I try it. It is possible that the Kotlin team have changed something and the documentation has not been updated.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I can override the Kotlin settings manually in the Intellij module settings but it gets overridden every time I sync the gradle project and is not a good long term solution. The project is designed to be IDE independent.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Does anyone know how I could set up the core module for max compatibility with older versions of Android? </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I currently have the minimum API level set to 9 as this is the current LibGDX default but I'm willing to set this higher if it would be too difficult to target such a low API level.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Edit 1:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I just extracted the jar file produced by the core module and examined the class files using the  tool.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I ran the following command on a random class file</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>and it output text with the following text</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>using this question <a href=\https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9170832/list-of-java-class-file-format-major-version-numbers\>List of Java class file format major version numbers?</a> I determined that the class file is actually targeting JVM 1.6.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Therefore my original theory is wrong and there is another reason why older Android versions cannot load classes generated by Kotlin lambdas.</p>&#xA;

Converting container types in kotlin? <p>Maybe I missed something obvious...  All over the doc it seems to me that Kotlin has various kinds of sequences, which don't interoperate.  Even if it may be inefficient to copy a sequence – when I need to pass it to a function as a semantically same but different type, that can't be helped.  So I came up (only for Int and one way) with these constructors and converters:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there any reason not to have all such variants, maybe inline, in the standard library?  The 3rd one even allows a nice syntax for initialization:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;

Android Studio 3.0 Preview Missing Imports when refactoring Kotlin code <p>Whenever I try to refactor Koltin code on Android Studio 3.0 it simply removes all my \top level\ imports and starts using \inplace\ imports. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>By refactoring I mean, in this case, moving code around. So let's say I have a class under <strong>com.myapp</strong> package. If I move it to <strong>com.myapp.anotherpackage</strong> this issue happens</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Funny fact about this looks like it only happens when you move more than one file at the same time</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What it looks like:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Then after refactoring it goes like this</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href=\https://i.stack.imgur.com/kXHBK.png\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\><img src=\https://i.stack.imgur.com/kXHBK.png\ alt=\enter image description here\></a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It gets even worse if I have to refactor the code again, as every single import is \inlined\, the android studio doesn't refactor those, and I have to do fix them by hand. This is getting really annoying already, as I had to fix over 100 of these. Any thoughts on how to fix this?</p>&#xA;
Android class with context in object field in Kotlin <p>Is it ok to have a property in object class in Kotlin that has a context in it?

Kotlin generic casting to a more specific subclass <p>So I'm trying to mess with Kotlin and I have an old java MVP framework with sort of poor generics in java where we had to cast a generic interface to a more specific one, like &#xA;</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Which we would cast in a subclass as</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>In Kotlin I'm going for this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there anything I can do without fixing the generics in the base interface?</p>&#xA;

Kotlin idiom for working with non-null object and non-blank String representation <p>I have a nullable property (a Java object) that knows how to convert itself to a String, and if this representation is not empty, I would like to do something with it.

Kotlin stdlib operatios vs for loops <p>I wrote the following code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>IntellJ (in my case AndroidStudio) is asking me if I want to replace the for loop with operations from stdlib. This results in the following code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now I must say, I like the changed code. I find it easier to write than for loops when I come up with similar situations. However upon reading what  function does, I realized that this is a lot slower code compared to the for loop.  function creates a new list containing only the elements from src that match the predicate. So there is one more list created and one more loop in the stdlib version of the code. Ofc for small lists it might not be important, but in general this does not sound like a good alternative. Especially if one should chain more methods like this, you can get a lot of additional loops that could be avoided by writing a for loop.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My question is what is considered good practice in Kotlin. Should I stick to for loops or am I missing something and it does not work as I think it works. </p>&#xA;

Can comparison operator overloading in Kotlin be used to implement SQL like functionality? <p>Kotlin has limited operator overloading. I'm wrapping an API that does vector-based operations, as they are done in languages like R, Julia, APL, etc. The most common example is in SQL where you can say:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>such that each record is evaluated individually, and added to a result-set if it passes the comparison. In Kotlin, comparison operator overloading is associated with a compareTo method:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>So it appears to me there is no way to use operator overloading to express a vector-oriented comparison operation. Am I missing something?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>A work-around would be to create functions using the infix keyword like:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>which could be invoked as:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>but this isn't nearly as legible </p>&#xA;

No way to compile my own kotlin library <p>With Google I/O 2017, I decided to learn kotlin by developing my own library in kotlin for android.

Kotlin automatic code calling in delegation pattern <p>I am making use of the Kotlin delegation pattern to mix and match several components into bigger components.  This has sped up my code, made it easier to read, more modular, more consistent etc.  All good things.  However, one thing I'm struggling with is a good pattern to deallocate my delegates.  Most of them have a  method that I use to take care of unsubscribing  subscriptions, canceling Android loaders, suspending execution of tasks etc.  Currently, I am doing stuff like:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Manually calling dispose on all delegated methods feels a bit clunky - is there an elegant way in Kotlin (via polymorphism, more delegation, etc) to make sure that a class calls certain methods of delegates automatically - in this case, it's clean up methods, but the same could be applied for any operation that all delegates need to do.</p>&#xA;

Kotlin/Java functional and immutable way of collecting a map in a map <p>Currently i'm reading a file through the Java API and adding items to a map through the method foreach which forces me to make use of the mutablemap. Is there a way of collecting the items without the mutablemap? I know there is a method collect but I couldn't get it working.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>the current way:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>EDIT:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>my goal is to merge the triple objects based on the first value of the triple.&#xA;So a scenario would be two triple objects(1, 2, 5.5) and (1,3, 5.5). The first value of the triple is the user id, the second is the article id and the third is the rating of the article. &#xA;after merging there would be one single entry in the map containing the first key = the user id, the first value of the triple, and the value would be a map containing the articles which the user rated.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It is currently working how I want it to work, but I was curious if there was a more functional way of solving this.</p>&#xA;

How kotlin delegation is useful? <p>I'm really confused about the kotlin delegation. Let me describe the regular polymorphism approach here which looks same like the kotlin delgation.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I can pass any implemented class of  interface to  variable to call the method of specified class's object. Then what is the benefit of 's delegation? Which is described <a href=\https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/delegation.html\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>here</a>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I know this is the simple scenario where the both codes are working fine. There should be a benefit of delegation that's why kotlin introduced it. What is the difference? and how kotlin delegation can be useful? Please give me a working example to compare with polymorphism approach.</p>&#xA;

New instance of extended object in Kotlin <p>I'm new to Kotlin coming from Groovy. As a way to study the language I'm trying to reproduce a few small Groovy examples on Kotlin.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Consider the following:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have a few Spring Data applications that I'm trying to reproduce in Kotlin and some of them use @Inheritance. The \problem\ I'm having is that an Email always have to have a Person. But Email get that property from BaseContact so I can't do something like the bellow because \person\ is not part of the constructor.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This will work though:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Because after the email is instantiated I can now access the \person\ property.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there any way on Kotlin for me to achieve a more \Groovy-like\ way to instantiate new objects without having to create many overrides for it's constructor? I'm specially interested on the case of extended classes.</p>&#xA;

Maven dependency using Kotlin not bringing in Kotlin classes <p>I have two projects, one which is a dependency on the other.

Unit testing Room and LiveData <p>I'm currently developing an app using the newly <a href=\https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html\ rel=\noreferrer\>Android Architecture Components</a>. Specifically I'm implementing a Room Database that returns a object on one of it's queries. Insertion and querying works as expected, however I have an issue testing the query method using unit test.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here is the DAO I'm trying to test:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>NotificationDao.kt</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>}</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>As you can tell, the query function returns a  object, if I change this to be just a ,  or basically whatever then I get the expected result, which is the data inserted in the Database. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The issue is that the following test will always fail because the  of the  object is always :</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>NotificationDaoTest.kt</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>So the question is: <em>Does anyone knows of a better way to perform unit tests that involve LiveData objects?</em></p>&#xA;
Kotlin, JPA and @Transient <p>I have an Entity class that I have migrated from Java to Kotlin. One of the properties () is annotated with  to prevent it from being persisted to the relational database. However, JPA (Hibernate implementation) does not see this annotation and places it in the database as it's own field. This all works properly when the class is written in Java.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Does anyone known how to properly annotate this Kotlin class so that JPA/Hibernate will see the  annotation and not place the  property in the database?</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;
Explanation on Function literal with receiver in Kotlin <p>I was following this link <a href=\https://kotlin.link/articles/DSL-builder-in-Kotlin.html\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>https://kotlin.link/articles/DSL-builder-in-Kotlin.html</a> to understand the builder implementation in Kotlin. I didn't understand the methods inside Builder class. Method  receives Extension Function as an argument which receives nothing and returns String. And the caller calls . If the caller is passing String to  method, how does it translate to an Extension method which returns String ?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I tried following Kotlin documentation for Function literals with receivers but all had samples which returns  or refers to DSL Builders. Tried googling it as well to understand but no luck in grasping the concept. </p>&#xA;

Repeating actions on state with RxJava <p>This is in Kotlin, but I think anyone who writes Java will be able to understand.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm trying to make a stopwatch with Rx and I'm having a little trouble with doing the actual stopping and starting. The big problem is that I don't know how to keep the current time, while modifying it as different actions (starting and stopping) come in. Here's what I've got right now.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Where  and  are s that emit events about the current starting time to count down from and say what to do next, respectively. I want to chain off of  and be able to keep state starting at  that will count down when a  event appears, pause when  appears, and reset at  when  appears.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p> almost works, but I don't know how to stop after the timer hits 0 and  is still being sent every second, since it would be sending duplicate info. Also it doesn't allow a separation between the state and the observed value. So the value I accumulate with  has to be the same type as the value inside the  (if that makes sense).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Any ideas what I should do?</p>&#xA;

Extending RxJava Observable in Kotlin with proper disposal <p>I'm trying to create a new operator for RxJava that works similar to , but can take two different types.

How do I change button text and function in Android? <p>I am an Android beginner. Here is what I am trying to do. I have an activity UI with three buttons. A second activity is identical however the buttons text and actions are different. Rather than have it switch intents or activities when buttons are clicked on the the first activity, can I code the buttons to change when clicked? This way I wouldn't need a second identical UI.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The three buttons are Login, SignUp and Tour. When Login or Tour are clicked I do indeed want them to launch different activities. But for \SignUp\ this is where the UI would be identical containing the same buttons but different text and will launch different intents. My goal is to eliminate this identical UI and just have the buttons change on the first screen when \Sign Up\ is clicked.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here is my current code which just launches new intents on click. I am not sure where to start to get the functionality I want. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;

Converting file (tracked with Git) from Java to Kotlin in Android Studio <p>A conversion from Java to Kotlin in Android Studio 2.3.2 (in 3.0 the same behaviour) creates a new file and deletes previous.

How can do the same in Android Studio.</p>&#xA;

Fetching a URL in Android Kotlin asynchronously <p>So I'm trying to write a very simple Android app that fetches a response from a URL when a button gets pressed.

Can kotlin define dynamic method when class init? <p>My class:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Function names are dynamic.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Can Kotlin do this?</p>&#xA;
Higher order (or recursive?) generic type parameters in kotlin <p>I'm prototyping some highly declarative code, and the type inference and safety that comes with Kotlin helps a lot. One of the goals is making extensions (subclasses) of the primary types stupidly easy to implement. In order to maintain rich type inference and expressiveness, I've found some success in defining generic extension functions projected against subclasses. All the type information of subclass methods with none of the extra subclass implementation, it's great.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So I'm trying to write a rich generic function that maintains as much type information as possible. The issue creeps up with the fact that this function operates on potentially recursively generic types, and I want to shuffle the generic type parameters.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This would be impossible to describe without an example. So consider:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>We want a function that effectively can do this, except generically</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Goal Criteria:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Takes  as a param and returns , except with different generic type parameter</li>&#xA;<li>I'd like to generalize this behavior as an extension function of all subclasses of &#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>It needs to be an extension function so that using generic types we can have the type of the subclass and ensure the argument has a generic type argument of the receiver type. </li>&#xA;<li>Or in other words, we want an extension function for subclasses of  so the argument must be  instead of  when invoked on  </li>&#xA;</ul></li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>That describes the gist of the problem.</strong> I'm not sure the language is capable of supporting what I want. I'm not sure if type erasure is a factor that makes this impossible, but so far I can't find it so (maybe I could use help if it is so).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The following is close</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>but there are a few problems</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>It returns  instead of . It would be nice if it could return  and not lose type information (otherwise I don't really have a use for this function anyway)</li>&#xA;<li>There is technically no guarantee  is </li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thinking ahead, if something like the following was valid Kotlin, I think it would address my problem</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there a reason it can't be done? e.g. added as a feature on the language? I am sympathetic to logistical reasons against, but I'm curious if it is even possible in principle too.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Last notes:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>It reminds me of type aliases except for generic type parameters themselves. In fact I've included that keyword in the example in case it helps to digest. That isn't the only part though, notice  and  in the syntax.</li>&#xA;<li>It almost reminds me of Monads as well, except with class definitions themselves if that makes sense in a sort of hand wavy, intuitive way.</li>&#xA;<li>I have no idea how to implement the body yet, but I haven't gotten that far since I'm still trying to see if the signature is even possible :p</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;

Extending data class from a sealed class in Kotlin <p>I have a set of data classes that share some common fields, So ideally I'd like to declare those in a supertype (Message in this example), and be able to write functions that operate on the supertype if they need access to these common fields (messageId in this example).</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I tried to accomplish this by extending my data classes from a sealed class.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Data classes may extend sealed classes, but not I'm not sure how/if they can accept arguments required by the \supertype\ sealed class.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li><p>Extending a regular class from a sealed class compiles just fine.</p>&#xA;&#xA;</li>&#xA;<li><p>However, changing it to a data class doesn't compile (\Data class primary constructor must have only property (val/var) parameters.\).</p>&#xA;&#xA;</li>&#xA;<li><p>Declaring the parameter as a property also doesn't compile (\'messageId' hides member of supertype 'Message' and needs 'override' modifier'\).</p>&#xA;&#xA;</li>&#xA;<li><p>Opening the supertype property and overriding it in each of the base classes compiles fine:</p>&#xA;&#xA;</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Ideally I would like something close to Option 2 - it allows me to combine the best of both worlds.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Otherwise, it seems my options are either handrolling my own data class functionality (copy, hashcode, equals etc) with option 1, or live with a compromise by opening up up the supertype properties with option 4.</p>&#xA;

How to properly handle a null variable perspective in kotlin? <p>My old java version method looks like: </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>As you can tell it is checked whether the null reference link to a dialog  and if not null check call method , and only then caused a method of close - .

Confused about RxJava variable Assignment <p>I have a function that takes in a username String and returns whether or not the user already exists in a MongoDB database.

I'm guessing this is because of the anonymous class that I created within the subscribe method, but I still can't pin why. </p>&#xA;

Android Studio 3.0 Kotlin changes are not reflected in the build <p>Has anyone tried the new android studio with 3.0 for kotlin. I am seeing a weird issue where the Kotlin code changes are not reflected when I run the app but the java changes can be seen. When I debug the app, the code won't stop at the new lines of code. Also I've particularly seen that during runtime Java complains that the new method that I wrote in Kotlin cannot be found.(But the java code which was written at the same time can be seen) The only solution I've found is either to rebuild the app or uninstall and reinstall. Any solutions for this problem. &#xA;NB: I've instant run OFF and also tried incremental compilation on kotlin build  OFF/ON</p>&#xA;
Call Kotlin object with class delegation from Java as a static method <p>This may be a bit difficult to describe, so I'll try to give a concrete example of what I'm trying to do.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Suppose we have a Facade interface and class (in java), like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>In my applications, I need to have multiple singletons which hold an instance of the facade. The real facade has additional setup/config parameters but those are irrelevant here.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Before I started using kotlin, I would have class which held a static instance of the facade (not really a singleton, but in my case it served a similar purpose) which proxied the calls to the facade, like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now, with Kotlin we have class delegates which allows me to write something like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is great - no more boilerplate and I can call  <strong>from Kotlin</strong> classes the same way I called the java :</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But, a slight problem arises when I use  <strong>from Java</strong>. Then I have to specify :</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I am aware of the  annotation, but the only place I can put it in the  file without causing compile errors is right before  and it doesn't seem to do the trick.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there a way to set up this class delegate so that I can call it from Java as if it were a static method, without introducing the boilerplate of creating proxy methods for  (which would defeat the purpose of the class delegate)?</p>&#xA;

Kotlin: Sorting | Location of swap operation <p>I'm implementing the Quicksort algorithm in Kotlin. For that, I created an interface, <em>ISort</em>, with a type parameter and a single function, <em>sort</em>. For sorting, I need the swap operation. I was wondering what the best location of this swap function is. My ideas:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>1) Unfortunately, in Kotlin one cannot make interface function protected. Thus, every class could see the swap in its implementations and that's not too nice (although it's not too bad either, I agree).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>2) Putting it in the QuickSort implementation is even worse because there might be several implementations of the ISort interface that need a swap function.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>3) My next thought was to create a singleton object but Kotlin permits objects with type parameters.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here is the interface definition:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And here is the skeleton of the QuickSort class:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, from a software engineering perspective what would be the best place / location for the swap operation.</p>&#xA;
Kotlin bound callable references inconsistency <p>Today I was creating unit tests for my Presenter in Android app and I noticed some inconsistency with bound callable references. Is it under development or is it language bug? I found <a href=\https://stackoverflow.com/a/33805243/4643073\>that</a> in kotlin 1.1 bound callable references are supported. But my code fails with kotlin 1.1.2-4.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In my presenter class, tested method reads data from database and  method have no parameters while view takes list --> . </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm using Mockito, RxJava2 and Room Persistance library.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have created test for  method</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>When I have setup as above, the test passes without problems. But when I change line<br>&#xA; </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>to </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Then my test fails saying</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is it language bug? Because vulnerable code compiles fine and runs, it just causes the method to not be invoked at all, without any errors. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>To clarify, the same code written in Java 8 works fine, lambda argument is correctly passed into method reference. As you can see in Kotlin bound callable references work fine when used with methods that takes no parameters, otherwise they are not called at all.</p>&#xA;
Calling kotlin functions which are keywords in java from java? <p>Since  is not a keyword in kotlin, i can have the following function in kotlin. </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But i am unable to call this function from java since  is a keyword in java. I would like to know if there is some alias for this function in java realm. I did not find any intellij suggestions that might be a possible alias to this function.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Edit 1</strong>:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have written the following code in kotlin:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And I had a look at the java bytecode. It was as follows.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And here is the bytecode decompiled to java:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>It appears that writing a function named new is a valid java bytecode. But  is not letting me compile the code. Is there some annotation or compiler flag I can enable to get  to compile the java file with call to this function.</p>&#xA;

Is it possible to create a recursive function type in Kotlin? <p>I have functions that represent steps in a process. Each function also knows the next step, if there is one.

How to detect values changed in Data class Kotlin? <p>I want to detect any values changed of a property of my class so then I could do another operation after that. In other word, if one of a specific data of a property is changed, then a specific event will fire by then. Actually, if it is a normal class in another programming languages such as Java, then I think I could use setter to do this job after data have modified or use delegate in C#. But since Kotlin is very new, I could not find any solution out there at all. &#xA;I have tried to overload property but was not successful by any chance. I wanted to use interface to to this too, but again since it is data class, I got no idea how should it be done. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Below is the sample class. In such situation, how to detect when Age or name is changed?</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>So please if anyone have any ideas about this, please help.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><em>Note: in my situation, data class must be used.</em></p>&#xA;

I'll paste the whole ViewHolder for completion, but note specifically the lambda in :</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This works for the first item I check, but after that I'm unable to click any other checkboxes. I thought the  would destroy itself, but perhaps I can't do this inside the lambda? Do I need to pull the Single outside of it somehow? </p>&#xA;

Kotlin Kmongo insert and return inserted item <p>I just tried to make a clean dummy project in Kotlin to practice but as Java does Kotlin does the same way the insert method.

Kotlin compiler complains about using a SPeL expression in a property definition. WHY? <p>So, I am experimenting with Kotlin. One of the ways I get to know a new language is by taking an existing simple application and simply porting it.

The compiler clearly knows it's a SPeL expression and doesn't like it. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>MY question(s):</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li><p>Why doesn't Kotlin like SPeL? This is a construction injection (or is it) and doesn't violate immutability.</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>Is this a compiler bug? The message is irrefutably wrong.</p></li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;

Kotlin cannot identify parameters unless explicitly referenced <p>There is an issue that is befuddling me when trying to write an Android project in Kotlin.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>When I try to call some basic Android library functions, the compiler is asking for very specific references.

Reading up to null character in Kotlin character by character from socket response <p>So say I have a stream being returned from a socket connection.  The stream is being returned terminated with '\\0' but in kotlin I can't seem to get this to work the same way.  The code below is in Java and I am probably just over looking something simple. </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>If anyone knows how to do this while communicating with a socket with the streams in Kotlin. The other post that is on here is covering reading the full string of text.  The socket is returning a longer string delimited by the '\\0'.  So the issue is I need to be able to load up the first string then the second string.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Example code from kotlinlang.org shows this as a solution using the Java to Kotlin converter.  Note that this code does not compile because of the assignment in the while statement.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here is what I have so far but the this implementation is just hanging up the processes and is locking the unit test for the API call.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;

That is:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Instances from type  have a  method that return an optional  from type  as well (a  in <strong>Kotlin</strong>).

returning the last expression in a block <p>I am learning the new and very beautiful language Kotlin and everything seems to be very logical and consistent.

In the next example  or  are returned depending on the condition - in our case it returns .</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>On the other hand this does not hold for any code block.

This does not even compile.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>So what exactly is the rule? Is it really so arbitrary like: if in  or  statement which is used as expression there is a block of code, then the last expression in the block is returned. Otherwise the last expression is not returned to outer scope. Or am I missing something?</p>&#xA;

Initializing a RecyclerView with Android Data Binding in Kotlin is throwing an error. What am I doing wrong? <h2>Description</h2>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I am trying to set up an Android screen in Kotlin with a RecyclerView using android data binding. I have an activity that contains a fragment and the fragment contains a RecyclerView that I initialize with data binding.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The issue is that when I try to set my recycler view's layout manager the application throws an IllegalStateException complaining that the specified child (I'm assuming it means either the RecyclerView or the LayoutManager) already has a parent and that I need to run removeView(). I have tried removing all views from the RecyclerView, but to no avail.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<h2>Here is my activity:</h2>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<h2>Here is my fragment:</h2>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<h2>And here is my fragment layout:</h2>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>When I try to run this, I get an error on my recyclerview when I try to set the LayoutManager:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>So my question is: What am I doing wrong?

named functions vs lambda reflexion <p>I am still learning Kotlin and trying to understand its core principles. What I do not get is this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>we get the following output:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>My question is why the output is not the same (I believed these functions should be interchangeable, equivalent)? I think the type of all the functions should be . Why do we keep the original name with the function signature () even though it is assigned to a different name ()? Is there any language design principle which would require such difference in function signatures?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>And a bonus question - why do we need to use the operator . It does not compile without it. But why is this required by the language design? Would not  work just fine and be much simpler?</p>&#xA;

Null safety in legacy Java libraries used in Kotlin pojects <p>Let's say I have particular code in old/legacy Java library:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The first two parameters are properly annotated with @NotNull and @Nullable annotations (using jetbrains.annotations). The third one (<strong>unnanotatedString</strong>) is left without proper annotation.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>When I use this class in my Kotlin code and set all the constructor arguments to non-null values, everything is fine:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The first value is non-null so I can access it without a safe call. Second value and I need to use safe call (nullableString?.length), if not, I have a compile-time error, so far so good. On the third value (unannotatedString) I can use it without a safe call, it compiles fine.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But when I set the third parameter to \null\ I don't get a compile-time error (no safe call required, only runtime NullPointerException:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is that expected behaviour?

Launch overlay activity without showing the rest of the app <p>I currently have an app composed of multiple activities, one of which is a translucent one. The app has notifications, and when I tap it, I want it to open the translucent activity on top of whatever is currently on the screen. As of now, this works if my app is closed, but if it is running and my overlay activity opens, the rest of my app is also in the foreground. I'd like to make it so that only the overlay is there, and once the user presses back, it will go back to their original app.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This sort of mimics google chrome's tab activity.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I am currently launching my activity through a PendingIntent:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Those flags are what I have when I launch the activity elsewhere, but they don't seem to affect this pending intent.

Bridge design pattern resulting in too many generics <p>I'm currently working on something for Minecraft, and I'm using the bridge pattern so my code can used with two separate server platforms, Sponge and Bukkit, with different (but somewhat similar) API's.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have my core code, which depends only on abstractions of common things in Minecraft that I will need later on, such as players and items, as well as abstract factory and builder classes. The code for the specific server platforms will implement the factories and builders, and provide them as dependencies to the core code.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This has been working pretty well so far, but I'm running into an issue with abstractions that depend on each other. For example, I have adapters for Minecraft inventories and items that adapt from the server platform's item/inventory type, to my own abstract item/inventory type. Item and inventory objects will need to interact with each other, and since the core code doesn't know about the implementation, I've resorted to using generics. Here's some pseudocode:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The Item class adapts an item from the item type used by the server platform. The  method implementations will use the  method to add an instance of the server platform's item to an instance of the server platform's inventory. Overall, generics provide a solution to interaction between platform specific objects.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The problem I've been running into, however, is generics getting complicated as the size of the project increases. One reason is that classes that use items/inventories will require the same generics. For example, all players have an inventory:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And something that uses a player needs to have generics, and so forth.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The second issue is that there are more interactions between instances than just these two, which could mean several generic parameters for an object, and therefore more generics on all the classes that use that object.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I suppose another solution would be not using generics at all, changing  to return an  type, and blindly cast, trusting that it's the correct type (which it will be).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I've put a ton of thought into this, and this is about the best I could come up with. I'm wondering if there are any other solutions that I'm missing, or any design patterns that might help with this problem.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If having the source would help, you can find it here:&#xA;<a href=\https://github.com/BenWoodworth/FastCraft/tree/master/src/main/kotlin/net/benwoodworth/fastcraft\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>https://github.com/BenWoodworth/FastCraft/tree/master/src/main/kotlin/net/benwoodworth/fastcraft</a></p>&#xA;

What does ?. mean in Kotlin when used on the left side of an assignment? <p>According to the <a href=\https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>Kotlin docs</a>, the ?. operator represents a 'safe call', meaning that if it's used in a chain of method calls, the entire chain will return null if the value of whatever it's used on is null.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But what about if it's used on the left side of an assignment?

Inline setter or Not to create unused setter in Kotlin? <p>I noticed that Kotlin create <strong>setter</strong> for <strong>var</strong>, and set value via <strong>setter</strong> instead of set it directly. Can we make setter <strong>inline</strong>? or set value directly without create <strong>private setter</strong> method by default?</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;

Implementation of a \valve\ for Observable streams, including buffering the last element emmitted before the valve reopened <p>I'm trying to wrap my head around how to implement something in RxJava (2.0). It's for Android and I'm using Kotlin, although the choice of platform and language shouldn't matter here.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The idea is that I'd base some sort of MVP architecture on RxJava. In this implementation I'm thinking about an  (could be a  or a custom  as well) exposes a stream of values (s for simplicity) which indicate lifecycle events, or whether the view is attached or detached.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The underlying idea is basically this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And then from the other end, the Presenter exposes an  that is a stream of objects representing screen states - to be rendered by the View. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>(This follows the concept explained in this series <a href=\http://hannesdorfmann.com/android/mosby3-mvi-1\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>http://hannesdorfmann.com/android/mosby3-mvi-1</a> - which boils down to the fact that the Presenter feeds the View with standalone objects encapsulating screen states in their entirety rather than multiple different methods on the View). </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>And then I'd like to bind these two observable streams so that:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li><p>Whenever the View gets detached, input from the Presenter is disregarded (and it's not buffered, so as not to run into any backpressure problems)</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>However, once the View gets reattached, it picks up the <em>latest</em> state the Presenter emmitted. In other words, only one state instance is to be buffered at most.</p></li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It would work as follows (assuming the states are of  type for simplicity):</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm not sure what the best, idiomatic solution is. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I tried to implement it as an , but I couldn't quite get it right. I believe the transformer should be stateless, whereas my solution gravitated towards explicitly keeping track of what was emmitted and buffering the last element \manually\ etc., which feels messy and too imperative, so I suppose it's wrong. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I found <a href=\https://github.com/akarnokd/RxJava2Extensions/blob/master/src/main/java/hu/akarnokd/rxjava2/operators/FlowableValve.java\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>https://github.com/akarnokd/RxJava2Extensions/blob/master/src/main/java/hu/akarnokd/rxjava2/operators/FlowableValve.java</a>, but the implementation looks very complex and I can't believe it couldn't be done in a simpler manner (I don't need all the flexibility, I only want something that works for the described usecase).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Any insights would be appreciated, including whether there's something else I should take into consideration still, within the context of Android. Also note that I don't use RxKotlin bindings (I may, I just didn't suppose they should be required here).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Below is my current implementation. As I said, I'm not too happy about it because it's explicitly stateful, and I believe this should be achieved declaratively, leveraging some constructs of RxJava.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I needed to merge two streams of different types, and because  nor  didn't quite do it, I resorted to a trick, creating a common wrapper for both distinct type of events. It introduces certain overhead again.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>sealed class Event&#xA;class StateEvent(val state: String): Event()&#xA;class LifecycleEvent(val attached: Boolean): Event()&#xA;&#xA;class ValveTransformer(val v

RxKotlin (RxJava2) timeout() doesn't throw TimeoutException <p>I'm trying to get an example working that uses two different timeout values.

With the value set below 500ms, I'm expecting a stack trace to be printed, but I get output as if no timeout has occurred (subsequent emissions with timeout set to 40ms results in stack trace as expected).

Is there a way to deploy backend (Kotlin) server application to Firebase? <p>I have already written a <strong>backend server application</strong>, which executes rather complicated tasks in Kotlin and it is running fine on my local machine.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I looked into Firebase and found out that you could host your website and create your database. My <strong>server application</strong> is basically a <strong>database</strong>, plus everything to handle it. I think that it should be possible to write the same database with <strong>Firebase's database</strong> too, but I think that that would require quite some time and I would need to learn how to access the database from <strong>Android</strong> and also <em>understand how the Firebase database works and how to implement my functionality</em>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<h3>Concluding</h3>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My question basically is, <em>if it is possible to deploy my already written app to Firebase</em> and access it like before. Maybe through the website hosting and a link to my <em>Kotlin app</em>. I could not really find any information on how to do something like this.</p>&#xA;

What is the editor magic behind Kotlin Android Extensions for Views? <p>When I add an import of the form  to a Kotlin source it alters the behavior of the Android Studio editor.  Specifically, it now considers any property of type  to have a property corresponding to each view in the layout file that is assigned an id.  I am assuming that I am doing this in a class that is <em>not</em> an  or .</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example, say I have a  declared in the source file and I add a property to it called  of type .  Further, say that I have a layout named  that has three view declarations that have been assigned the ids, , , and .  When I add a synthetic import of the form above with a <em>layout-name</em> of  suddenly  has three new properties, , , and .  Or, more correctly, the editor makes it appear as though  has these properties.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>After some research, I have concluded the following:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li><p>The addition of layout view ids as properties is done blindly.  Any view id implied by a such a synthetic import is added to any property of the class that is of type  (or a subclass of ).  This includes properties of such type inherited by the class.</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>Because the properties are added blindly it is incumbent upon the developer to ensure that the runtime view corresponding to the synthetic import is assigned before the synthetic properties are accessed or an exception will be thrown.</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>If two or more such imports are specified in a file then the union of their view ids will be blindly added to all class properties of type .</p></li>&#xA;<li><p>The purpose of allowing multiple imports is to account for the case where one layout file includes another.</p></li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Are these conclusions correct?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Are any other interesting subtleties around the implementation of this feature?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I am using version 1.1.2-5 of the kotlin-gradle-plugin.</p>&#xA;

Concurrent S3 File Upload via Kotlin Coroutines <p>I need to upload many files to S3, it would take hours to complete that job  sequentially.

Combining mandatory and arbitrary optional constructor arguments with Groovy <p>I am trying to determine, purely out of interest, whether it is possible to completely remove the need to use the Builder pattern in Groovy by using named and default constructor arguments; that is, to solve the telescoping constructor problem using only the built in language features. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example, in Kotlin, it is possible to do the following:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This yields the following output:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The line of particular interest is where:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>yields</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Note that I was able to set <strong>optional2</strong> without having had to set <strong>optional1</strong>.  I am not sure this is possible in Groovy but, then again, I am far from expert. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>As a point of interest, looking at the generated byte code, the Kotlin compiler appears to generate a single constructor and then rewrites the instantiation statements to pass the optional arguments at the correct point in the argument list.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, to the Groovy experts, is this simply not possible in Groovy or am I yet to find the correct syntax?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks in advance,</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Simon</p>&#xA;

Java generics in Kotlin: Use Java raw type as method parameter in Kotlin <p>I'm looking at this class in Facebook sdk:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I want to have a method in Kotlin that accepts it's parent class, similar to the following:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But when I try to call it form java:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I get compile time error:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>P.S.

Why is the first computation in my Android app slow while all subsequent computations are fast <p>I'm using the symja android library to perform mathematical calculations for a quiz app I'm building. All of my calculations are performed by passing in a string such as \1+3 + (4/2)\ to a class within the library called ExprEvaluator(). A sample usage would be </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>When I run my quiz app and answer a question for the first time, the main UI Thread would freeze as it performed the calculation, but all subsequent calculations would be incredibly fast. Below, I have outlined a bunch of strategies I tried in order to solve the problem. Note: I have injected the ExprEvaluator class with Dagger, and it exists as a singleton </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Strategy 1: Offload the computation to a seperate thread&#xA;Result: Didn't make a difference in initial computation time and actually resulted in more issues because I needed the result on the main UI Thread. All subsequent computations were fast as usual. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Strategy 2: Run a simple initial computation on my SplashScreen Activity.&#xA;Result: This is the best possible solution I have found yet but the only drawback is that my splash screen takes too long. Once inside the main app, the quiz performs very well. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Strategy 3: Run on a new Thread inside the Splash screen activity&#xA;Result: This solved the problem of the splash screen taking way too long to load but if I answer a question on the main thread and check it's correctness before other thread's initial computation is complete, the UI thread freezes. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I noticed that the first call to evaluate would always be slow, no matter the string I pass in. I could pass in \1\ and the evaluation would take around 4 seconds while all subsequent more complex evaluations take miliseconds at most. Even if I use a new instance of the ExprEvaluator class for every sincle computation like so: </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I still get a slow initial computation and all subsquent calls to evaluate are lightning fast. I'm not really sure what's happening here, and I'm wondering if it's a native android issue where heavy computation needs to performed at least once for all subsequent calculations to be smooth. </p>&#xA;
LibGDX Scene2d UI: Table inside table layout problems <p>I'm trying to do the following <a href=\https://i.stack.imgur.com/WmZCb.png\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>layout</a> with this code (the widths and heights are just for debug, ideally I would have both of the tables have 50% of the width.

Kotlin: function delegation <p>I have a project that depends heavily on delegation and composition in Kotlin.  Delegating properties is a breeze, but conceptually I'm not completely sure how to achieve delegation for functions in circumstances where the functions depend on other composed properties.  I'd like to do something like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Of course, this type of thing would be achievable with the following:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>but this feels clunky as it requires passing in objects for composition which bloats the size of the constructors - it would be cleaner for me to initialize the objects at the site of the class itself as they have no use outside of the class.  Is there an elegant way to this with delegation and/or extensions?</p>&#xA;

Why use Declaration-Site Variance <p>This is not a Kotlin specific question but I would like to better understand why I would use declaration-site variance (covariant and contravariant).

How to initialize a reference variable in Kotlin <p>In Java one can initialize a reference variable with null, for example a String variable can be initialized like so:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But in Kotlin, the point is to avoid using null as much as possible.

Change Navigation drawer item color filter also change the imageView which is use same image id <p>In the app have Navigation drawer contains a lot of menu items. The limitation is, there is one item will show its color instance of tint color but the other show tint. With this limitation, I decided to use the color filter to handle the icon color stage of the item drawer. This path work perfectly fine.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>And my menu looks like this.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Every menu</strong> expect the main menu should show color state like this</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><em>selected: blue</em></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><em>not selected: gray</em></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Main menu</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><em>selected: show its color</em></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><em>not selected: gray</em></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>And the code to handle the state look like this</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>The problem is</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If I use imageView and set drawable as same as one of the menu item. The color state will change following the menu item. I don't want to change the tint color of the imageView. But it changes according to the menu item. Then I add tint color in imageView to change to different thin color but it still shows the same color of the menu. For example.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>In this case, imageView should show only black color. But it show gray or blue according to the menu.</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The expecting result is the imageView should tint color from the color I set in the XML</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But the result is it shown the same tint color like the menu item.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I think it independently, can someone explains why this issue happened and how to fix it&#xA;<strong>In the project use data binding and Kotlin</strong></p>&#xA;

How to: fire and forget async coroutines in Kotlin <p>I've been reading up on Kotlin co-routines but am not finding the answer to a specific problem.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Say I want to iterate over a collection making an API call for each element (in this particular case pushing a file to Amazon S3).

How to obtain all subclasses of a given sealed class? <p>Recently we upgraded one of our enum class to sealed class <strong>with objects as sub-classes</strong> so we can make another tier of abstraction to simplify code. However we can no longer get all possible subclasses through  function, which is bad because we heavily rely on that functionality. Is there a way to retrieve such information with reflection or any other tool?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>PS: Adding them to a array manually is <em>unacceptable</em>. There are currently 45 of them, and there are plans to add more.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is how our sealed class looks like:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>If there is an values collection, it will be in this shape:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Naturally no one wants to maintain such a monster.</p>&#xA;

What is the right approach when Kotlin function does not take nullable type <p>So I was solving Koans problem and through my overly complex solution bumped into a thing that bothers me. I was using Int.compareTo() function on nullable types.

Using JavaCV with Kotlin <p>I'm currently attempting to start a project using JavaCV in Kotlin. I'm using IntelliJ Idea as my IDE. I'm using JavaCV 1.3.2 and OpenCV 3.20. &#xA;This is my setup for the module's dependancies for OpenCV:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href=\https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ycmwx.jpg\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\><img src=\https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ycmwx.jpg\ alt=\OpenCV Project Library Configuration\></a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>and for JavaCV:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href=\https://i.stack.imgur.com/QFboF.jpg\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\><img src=\https://i.stack.imgur.com/QFboF.jpg\ alt=\JavaCV Project Library Configuration\></a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have opencv before javacv in the dependancies.&#xA;To test that OpenCV is present and valid, I wrote the below to test.

Retrieve JSON response from rxjava/retrofit POST request <p>I've created a POST request using rxjava and retrofit that successfully hits my backend server and logs the user in (I get a 201 response in my console, all good). However, I want to then retrieve the users access token that is returned, but when I try to access the rxjava result, it just gives me the object I passed to it. Nowhere can I find out how to get the json success response. I have also verified there is in fact a response in Postman, so it's something with how I make this call.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here is my Retrofit portion</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And the correspoinding API function</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The UserLogin model that is deserialized by Gson</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And finally the call in my LoginActivity</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The confusion comes when I try to access the result -> portion of the compositeDisposable call.

Missing crash reason at developer console <p>at my app crashes I see the line numbers and filenames, just not the extended crash reason.

Kotlin AAR library w/ proguard: how to keep extension methods? <p>I'm writing a new Kotlin library module to add commonly used classes and extension methods.  I'm compiling each extensions file (eg BitmapExtensions.kt) into a single file called 'Extensions' using :</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>As a part of our company's IP policy I need to obfuscate the library via proguard <em>before</em> it makes it to any consumer project.  I therefore need a proguard rule to keep these extension methods so that they are not thrown away.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>At first glance the below seems to work, inspecting the generated AAR's classes.jar shows that the extension methods still exist and their internals have been obfusecated.  But when actually compiling in a consumer project, I get unresolved references to any extension method I've referenced.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>When I disable minification, the project builds correctly.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How can I obfuscate my library and keep my kotlin extensions?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>edit: It appears that using  on the entire package, and even specifying  is not enough.  The methods simply cannot be referenced in the consumer app.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>edit2: I believe I have narrowed this down to the  file under /META-INF/ being removed when .  This appears to be the ONLY difference between my minified and non-minified classes.jar.  Something is removing this file... or preventing its generation.</p>&#xA;

Why does Kotlin allow having two classes with same name and package in different folders (i.e.: main and androidTest)? <p>I have discovered that in Kotlin it is possible to have two classes with the same name, in the same package but one of them in the androidTest folder, and when running Espresso tests, it will be this one the one used.&#xA;This is not possible under Java, and I'm wondering if it is an intended behaviour or it is due to something else.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href=\https://i.stack.imgur.com/nXE2t.png\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\><img src=\https://i.stack.imgur.com/nXE2t.png\ alt=\enter image description here\></a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In the image, AppCollaborator, in Kotlin exist in androidTest and main, AS does not complain, but it does about JavaCollaborator.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The fact is this behaviour is very useful in order to double some classes during test (API, Etc.), but I don't know if I can rely on it.</p>&#xA;

Kotlin top-level function scopes & shadowing <p>Let's say I write a Kotlin package containing the following code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Should the package be distributed in bytecode form, am I correct in assuming that Kotlin's rules on default importing of standard library modules as per <a href=\https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/packages.html\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>the documentation</a> and that subsequently importing another module such as CoolWithATwist will in fact shadow the standard library auto-included println function and thus the above code will execute should the user actually call println?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What is the best way of detecting this since Kotlin compiler doesn't warn about shadowing global functions or about having to explicitly name which function you're actually calling, nor does the Kotlin plugin on IntelliJ Idea (as of version 1.1.3) or, to the best of my Knowledge, Android Studio, say anything about it?</p>&#xA;

How to get the second fragment from the popBackStack list to pop? <p>Lets suppose I have 3 fragments A, B and C, A is addBackStack to B, fragment C on the other hand can replace both A and B and is not backStack to either of them, when fragment B is inflated and I call C, fragment A remains on the stack, now when I call popBackStack after inflating fragment C, it removes C and not the A below it, if I call it before inflating C it removes fragment B and the application crashes because than C is replacing a null fragment, what I want is to remove fragment A from the stack when C gets inflated, btw all fragments are replacing and I have to replace, adding any of the three fragments is not the solution for me, also popAllStack will remove all the fragments including the first one which I do not want, thanks in advance.</p>&#xA;

For example default parameters in Kotlin are still required in Java. Another one is, non-null parameters does not accept null in Kotlin app (compile time error) but throws run time exception when  is passed in Java. I know about null checks but they make the code look dirty.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What is the proper way to support Android Java apps? Direction, suggestions, examples are welcome. Thanks.</p>&#xA;

Best way to apply a transform to every element in a list at the same time in Kotlin <p>Basically I'm trying to apply a long-running transformation to a list of elements in Kotlin. Right now I'm using the .map function, but this causes all of the transformations to run serially, when I need them to run simultaneously because of time.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here's how it works now:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>As I explained, the function .map runs the transformation and then waits for it to finish before preceding to the next element. How should I alter this to allow the transformations to run concurrently and the proced when they're all finished?</p>&#xA;

How to create dynamic/transparent proxy in Kotlin? <p>In C#, we can use DynamicObject class for dynamic method invocation for example used to JsonRPC or so. In Python, using <strong>getattr</strong> and <strong>call</strong> does the same task. In general I need an object with no real methods that can be used as like containing methods. The name of the method and the arguments gets into a function and does the task. Using IoC we can do it uing Interception, but I need to know if is there another way (like dynamic in C#) without using interface and IoC.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example, Zabbix API has many JSON-RPC methods like host.create trigger.get ...&#xA;There is a Python wrapper that helps you call them so:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>zapi.trigger.get({\expandExpression\: \extend\, \triggerids\: range(0, 100)})</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Actually there are no attributes like 'login' and 'trigger within ZabbixAPI class!</p>&#xA;

Kotlinic pattern for using Spring Data JPA's \query by example\ <p>Spring Data JPA introduces a nice feature, <a href=\http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#query-by-example\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>\query by example\ (QBE)</a>. You express your search criteria by <em>constructing an instance of the entity</em>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>You do not have to write JPQL. It uses less \magic\ than does <a href=\https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories.query-methods.query-creation\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>repository query derivation</a>. The syntax is nice. It prevents explosions of trivial repository code. It survives refactors very well.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>There's a problem though: QBE only works if you can <em>partially construct</em> an object.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here's my entity:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre class=\lang-kotlin prettyprint-override\></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here's my repository (empty! this is a nice thing about QBE):</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre class=\lang-kotlin prettyprint-override\></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>And here's how you would fetch a  — all the products that are sold in some shop, in some city:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre class=\lang-kotlin prettyprint-override\></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Or at least, that's what I <em>want</em> to do. There's a problem. It's <strong>not possible</strong> to construct this object:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre class=\lang-kotlin prettyprint-override\></pre>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is because 's constructor requires that <em>all</em> its fields be defined. And indeed: that's what I want most of the time.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The usual compromise in Java would be: construct entities using no-args constructor, make everything mutable, have no guarantees about completedness.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there a nice Kotlin pattern to solve this problem:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li><em>generally</em> require that all args are instantiated on construction</li>&#xA;<li>provide <strong>also</strong> some mechanism to produce partially-constructed instances for use with Example API</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Admittedly these look like totally conflicting goals. But maybe there's another way to approach this?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example: maybe we can make a mock/proxy object, which appears to be a Product, but doesn't have the same construction constraints?</p>&#xA;

Eclipse - How to add Kotlin to a Tomcat Project - Compile Kotlin AND Java Files <p>I need help adding Kotlin compiling to an existing eclipse java tomcat project.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For the record I am on Eclipse Oxygen 4.7, and have installed the Kotlin plugin.  I have successfully created and ran gradle based spring boot Kotlin rest api demo and can compile and run \Kotlin Only Projects\ and use my other java libs - AWESOME.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However now that I have Kotlin I want to use it in work for my other 'legacy' Tomcat 8 projects that are Java J2EE - Dynamic WTP ... new servlets I want to write in Kotlin.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I want to be able to add a Kotlin class in the java src folder in any of my previous packages so when I build a war it all logically together.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The IDE seems ok with this - I created a Kotlin class in a package (in a tomcat project java src package folder)  and it have no issues on resolving, imports, or dependency...</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I was thinking WOW!,  Ok now to restart the Tomcat server in WTP and I'll be able to execute my Kotlin Servlet. No - 404 404 404.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I inspected the WEB-INF/classes build folder and along all the Java class files... guess what I saw?!  A file called KotlinServlet.kt ( thats the name of my test servlet, the source version not a compile class version)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So for some reason the build /package/ deployment did not bother to compile the *.kt file and just copied it over (maybe that is the default for general WTP deploy).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I wonder if this would be solved by \Add Kotlin Nature\ , the strange part is that none of the eclipse Kotlin menu functions are available to me.  If I right click my project I get no Kotlin menu options.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Eclipse states the plugin is installed.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So my question is:  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Given an existing conventional WTP Tomcat servlet project,  HOW can we get it to identify and a compile *.kt files?  How and why do I not have the Kotlin menu functions?   (I downloaded and tested both the Oxygen Java and J2EE version - installed the Kotlin plugin - and no menus there either to add a Kotlin Nature.  I also then tried the nightly build of the plugin. No menus appeared.   Obviously the puglin is installed compiling other Kotlin projects and works in the editor.</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>From my research -  \Add Kotlin Nature\ is supposed to do the trick for joint Java / Kotlin compiling but that menu function is not available anywhere??? </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If this is a \Kotlin Project\ eclipse compiles Kotlin fine.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Any Ideas?   Seems like an IntelliJ conspiracy.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks,</p>&#xA;

Robolectric test and LiveData <p>To get a hang of Kotlin, LiveData and Robolectric alltogether, I got a simple splash screen activity.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It works properly when running the application, but it fails to work in the test.

@Before annotation being ignored by kotlin in espresso test? <p>I have this instrumented test class written in kotlin and uses espresso to execute the tests.

Android Studio 3.0 Databinding reference code not genereted by android studio <p>I'm having problem with Android Studio 3.0 and combination of kotlin and data binding. I'm not sure why, but option Settings -> Editor -> Data Binding -> Reference code generated by android studio is not working as it should be.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I've tried it on different AS 3.0 versions (Canary 3, Canary 5, Canary 6) with different kotlin (1.1.2-3, 1.1.3, 1.1.3-2) and databinding compiler ver. To be sure I have even created clean project and the same problem occurs. I'm sure that the problem lies in kotlin and databinding combination because in the same project databinding in java class is working just fine, files generated by databinding are updated with every change in .xml file.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm not going to paste my every gradle content file here because I have tried a lot of combination versions of kotlin and data binding. Below is one of them.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I've noticed that while i'm in java file after click (ctrl + click) on file generated by Data binding ex.:activity_main.xml -> ActivityMainBinding.java my screen is being moved directly to activity_main.xml file. After the same action in Kotlin class screen is being moved to ActivityMainBinding.java file.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It's very annoying problem becasue with every change in .xml file I'm forced to rebuild project in order to use data binding. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Any kind of help or information will be appreciated</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>EDIT: Invalidate caches / restart helps only to first project build. If I create new .xml layout it's working fine until project build.</p>&#xA;

Cast Any to Array in Kotlin <p>I'm initializing a class by loading data from a  in Kotlin.  As this Map is gleaned directly from JSON, I don't know for certain that any given key exists, or that its value is of the type I expect.  To unpack this Map safely I'm doing the following, which appears to work perfectly:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Some of this data is in further nested JSON, which I'm unpacking to Arrays; I've tried to do this in the same way:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, when I attempt this using an array (as above) IntelliJ kicks up a fuss, saying</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is this just the IDE getting itself in a twist or is this method genuinely unsafe for Arrays despite being seemingly perfectly safe for other types?</p>&#xA;

Kotlin: secondary constructor with this keyword &#xA;&#xA;<p>I was wondering why I am getting an error saying that I cannot use the this keyword in the constructor call because I have not called the superclass constructor first.

IntArray vs Array<Int> in Kotlin <p>I'm not sure what the difference between an  and an  is in Kotlin and why I can't used them interchangeably:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><a href=\https://i.stack.imgur.com/rwdMu.png\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\><img src=\https://i.stack.imgur.com/rwdMu.png\ alt=\missmatch\></a></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I know that  translates to  when targeting the , but what does  translate to?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also, you can also have  or .

Is it possible to use Kotlin in Grails? <p>Some basic facts that lead me to this question:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>Groovy has complete Java interoperability</li>&#xA;<li>Kotlin has complete Java interoperability</li>&#xA;<li>Kotlin also compiles down to Java</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is it therefore possible to write Kotlin code in a Grails application?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I've worked quite a bit with Grails 2.x, and recently at a new job I have been working with Kotlin, Spring, and Struts. I <strong>really</strong> like the null-safety and type inference features of Kotlin, and the functional programming features of Kotlin feel much more natural and easy to use than in Groovy (this last part is pure opinion).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is it possible to use Grails to handle things like:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ul>&#xA;<li>ORM</li>&#xA;<li>Mapping requests to controllers/actions</li>&#xA;<li>JSP/GSP view parsing/rendering</li>&#xA;</ul>&#xA;&#xA;<p>but use Kotlin to write the actual logic of the domain classes, controller actions, services, object factories, etc.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Probably not likely, because I'm guessing that some of the core functionality of Grails is made possible by dynamic typing, but maybe it could be possible through either a Gradle plugin or a direct Grails plugin.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I like the extreme simplicity provided by the convention-over-configuration paradigm of Grails, but I much prefer the static typing and type inference of Kotlin.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If I could write business logic in Kotlin in a Grails environment, that, to me, would be the ultimate web application framework!</p>&#xA;
Kotlin: Running kapt in command line to generate stubs for DI <p>I'm trying to run kapt3 from command line to generate Java stubs for Kotlin files. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The syntax seems to be:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>Is this correct?</li>&#xA;<li>I don't see the plugin in the  folder.

How to display an in-app notification that doesn't stick around in the notification drawer à la Snapchat <p>So the idea is to present the user with a notification of some kind (doesn't have to be a standard Android notification, could be a library or custom) like Snapchat does.

Kotlin constructor properties and calling different superclass constructors <p>I'd like to use a kotlin data class as an exception, which seems fine:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'd also like to be able to pass in a  to the super class in those cases where one exists. Unfortunately, data classes can only have / in their primary constructor, and since the default constructor calls the no-args  constructor, it seems that I simply cannot do this without always requiring  to be passed, <em>and</em> stored as a field in my class, which I don't want.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What I want is something like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>It seems that even if I don't use a data class, I still can't use the convenient / constructor helpers, since they can only be on a primary constructor which must chose which super constructor to use. The best I can come up with is this, which is quite verbose:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Am I missing something? Is there really no way of conditionally calling a different super-class constructor based on overloaded constructors and still being able to use the / parameter syntax? If so, why? Are there better ways of doing this sort of thing?</p>&#xA;
Mutate string from an extension <p>I was trying to port a Swift script to Kotlin but it's not working as expected, what the code does is to consume a string while the condition is true (need it for a parser).

I will leave open this question but I ended up creating a class that implements only a few String class methods.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Usage example</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;

How do I fix the type inference error in a Completable transformed using RxLifecycle.bindToLifecycle()? <p>I am using Kotlin and RxJava2. It works fine in other types i.e. Observable etc, but when I am using a Completable type it gives me a type inference error :</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here is the code I am using:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;
How can I reference an unnamed argument of a when expression? <p>I have a <a href=\https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/control-flow.html#when-expression\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>when expression</a> that looks something like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now, I don't want to call  twice, but I also want this to remain a single expression. Is there a convenient way for me to access the value I passed into the when expression in its else block, such as the  or  syntax found elsewhere in the language?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm currently using the following work-around:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But this introduces another block, and is less readable than I'd like. <strong>Is there a better solution?</strong></p>&#xA;

Rebase method intercept, completely overriding method <p>I'm trying to do some runtime code changing using ByteBuddy. The problem that I've run into is that when I try to rebase a method to add an intercept call at the end, the entire method gets replaced and there isn't any $original() method declared and called after.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is the code I'm using for the proper transformation</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>clazz and dataFolder are defined above this and aren't the source of the problem.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is the signature of the injector method:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In analyzing the code it outputs, the class is identical to pre-transformation, but all the code that <em>was</em> getting called in the onEnable method has been removed, and replaced with the single method delegate. Is there a way, using a method like this, for me to keep the existing method body, but add a delegate call to the head of the method?</p>&#xA;

Kotlin sorting array of a class based off a var inside the class <p>I am having trouble finding the right code to sort my array. Inside my array is an array of a class I have created. Inside the class, there is a variable called Rank that contains an Int. I would like to sort my array based off that number inside the class (highest to lowest).

Rewrite Java code in Kotlin using Function Reference occurs SAM types conflict <p>I have an example Java code using method reference that I want to rewrite to Kotlin. Java version is using method reference, solution is short and clear. But on the other hand I cannot use method reference in Kotlin. The only version that I've managed to write is one presented below.

Detect Back Button Press in Android View <p>I am writing a game app that uses a ChessClock class.  Each of the two players has a clock.  The clocks send themselves a stream of messages every tenth of a second, and if running, decrement the time remaining.  When the time expires the clock calls a method in the parent view group that stops the clocks and sets a flag that causes further touch events to be ignored so that the users can no longer move the pieces.  I am writing in kotlin, but I think this will be clear to a java programmer also: </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This works fine, but if the user presses the back button and then starts a new game, the clocks apparently keep running, even though the activity's onDestroy method has been called.  Then when the running clock expires, the new game is frozen even though the new clocks are still running.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm new to android and I don't understand how this comes about.  I would have thought that the clocks would be destroyed when the activity was. I've tested my ideas about what is happening with log messages, and have confirmed that the clocks run after onDestroy are called.  I've also overridden onDetachedFromWindow to stop the clocks, and it makes the problem go away, but this is overkill.  It will also stop the clock if the user gets a phone call, won't it, and this is not what I want.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Can you suggest how to best accomplish what I want?  There is no way to access the clocks from the activity is there?  I've thought of emitting some event in onDestroy, and having the ChessClock listen for it, but I don't know how to write custom events and listeners yet.  Is there an easier way? </p>&#xA;

Kotlin reified type parameter can't be used as type parameter in body of function <p>A reified type parameter in Kotlin prevents type parameter erasure and allows the type parameter to be known at run-time.

Kotlin: Function-param implementation in a body of a caller &#xA;&#xA;<p>I recently stumbled over the syntax of calling a function in Kotlin and I just don't get it:&#xA;the fist option is clear - it's a lambda, but the second one looks not like a usual syntax of calling a function with the required parameter.

Insert code from Method into new class <p>I'm trying to make a library on top of bytebuddy that can be used to perform runtime transformations on a class. The API that I'm making isn't directly operable with ByteBuddy to insert method code into transformed classes, (I want unannotated methods to be added brand new to the transformed class, and methods annotated with  to be injected into the head or tail of an existing method), My solution to the lack of interoperability was to create a temporary class using ByteBuddy, that transforms between my higher level API, and the Advice API from ByteBuddy. But I can't figure out how I could insert all the code from a method in the higher level API into methods defined in the lower level one, since I can't actually use Advice to do it.

Kotlin extension generic function with basic types without reflection API <p>I have a Java object that has methods ,  and . I attempted to make a generic extension function that has a function as the last parameter. Essentially wrapping the try and catch and call to  etc that could throw an exception.

Disable META-INF/* generation in gradle android library kotlin project <p>Good day. I've written a kotlin android library and uploaded it on bintray. But when I try to use it (via gradle compile) in some project, it fails to build with following errors:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I've looked up both of these .jar files and they both contained  folder with  file. But more importantly generated .aar (android archive published in bintray) contained this folder as well as this file. I've checked other decent bintray android libraries and they don't seem to include any  files. However those that do include it (in most cases they contain license files) produce the same  and the way to resolve it is to explicitly exclude them in use-project's gradle file.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What's the use of this  file and how can I disable its generation during publishing? Because I don't want to explicitly exclude from every project which is using this library and I don't want to ask other developers to do so.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here's the library's repo: <a href=\https://github.com/arslancharyev31/Anko-ExpandableTextView/\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>https://github.com/arslancharyev31/Anko-ExpandableTextView/</a>&#xA;And it's bintray repo: <a href=\https://bintray.com/arslancharyev31/android/Anko-ExpandableTextView\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>https://bintray.com/arslancharyev31/android/Anko-ExpandableTextView</a></p>&#xA;
Consecutive animation in TornadoFX? <p>After reading through the documentation, I'm still a bit confused on how to execute an animation <em>after</em> another one has completed. I have a timeline like so:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This runs them all at once, but I would like to run each animation after the other one has finished! I can't quite figure out how to do this.. (<em>sorry if this is obvious, I am very new to Kotlin and Java in general!</em>)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I see that the keyframe has an  property but I can't quite figure out what I'm supposed to actually <em>set</em> it to. Is there a better way to do this? Thank you!</p>&#xA;

How to compile Kotlin domain module with client module with Gradle? <p>I have the following project structure:<br>&#xA; - <br>&#xA; - -  (written in Kotlin but compiled to JS)<br>&#xA; - -  (written in Kotlin)<br>&#xA; - -  (written in Kotlin)<br>&#xA; module has a dependency on . So when I compile  to JS it also should compile  with it. For now I have the following Gradle configurations which are not doing the desired thing:  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>project/parent.gradle</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>project/settings.gradle</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>project/model/build.gradle</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>project/client/build.gradle</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>When I run  command on  I get this message:  </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>These 3 classes are defined in .<br>&#xA;So what should I do to successfully compile  and not changing the code?</p>&#xA;
Why can a use block not safely initialize a var? <p>Why does this give a compile error?</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Maybe the compiler just sees  as a function that is passed to another function and has no knowledge about when or even if it will be executed?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But since  is not just a function but Kotlin's replacement for Java's try-with-resource, some special knowledge about it would be appropriate, wouldn't it? Right now, I am forced to initialize  with some dummy value, which is not in the spirit of Kotlin at all.</p>&#xA;

How to remove duplicate entries from FragmentManager? <p>I have a simple activity with a . I'm using fragments to implement the contents of the activity for the different pages.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>When the user presses the back button, it's supposed to go back to the previously looked at page. The problem is, when you repeatedly switch back and forth between the pages (fragments), this entire history is recorded. Take this example:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>A -> B -> A -> B -> C -> A -> C</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Pressing the back button would result in the reverse, but instead I want this behaviour (I noticed it in the Instagram app):</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>C -> A -> B -> Exit App</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So every fragment should only have one entry in the backstack. How do I do this? I do I remove the previous transactions for a fragment from the stack?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is this at all possible using a FragmentManager? Or do I have to implement my own?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My Activity with the BottomNavigationView:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;

Why the variable can't be initialized correctly in inline function as in java? <p>We know the lambda body is <strong>lazily</strong> well, because if we don't call the lambda the code in the lambda body is never be called.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>We also know in any function language that a variable can be used in a function/lambda even if it is not initialized, such as javascript, ruby, groovy and .etc, for example, the groovy code below can works fine:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>We also know we can access an uninitialized variable if the catch-block has initialized the variable when an Exception is raised in try-block in Java, for example:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>If the lambda is lazily, why does Kotlin can't use an uninitialized variable in lambda? I know Kotlin is a null-safety language, so the compiler will analyzing the code from top to bottom include the lambda body to make sure the variable is initialized. so the lambda body is not \lazily\ at compile-time. for example:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Q</strong>: But why the code below also can't be working? I don't understand it, since the variable is <strong>effectively-final</strong> in Java, if you want to change the variable value you must using an  instead, and this test contradicts my previous conclusions:\lambda body is not lazily at compile-time\ .for example:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>So I  only can think is that the compiler can't sure the  field in  is whether initialized or not, but @hotkey has denied my thoughts. <strong>Why</strong>?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Q</strong>: why does Kotlin inline functions can't works fine even if I initializing the variable in catch-block like as in java? for example:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But, @hotkey has already mentioned that you should using  expression in Kotlin to initializing a variable in <a href=\https://stackoverflow.com/a/45240753/7607923\>his answer</a>, for example:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Q</strong>: If the actual thing is that, why I don't call the  directly? for example:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>However the code above can works fine in java, for example:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;

Do I need to update Kotlin every time I work on my company's application? <p>I'm having trouble building an Android project at the company I am working for. Currently, I get a whole bunch of errors when I try to build my project due to the specified versions of the dependencies defined in the .gradle file not matching the current version of kotlin.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, to rectify this I have updated the highlighted dependency versions in the project to match the current version of kotlin I am using. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My big question is whether I have to do this every time I want to develop on Android? I'm assuming the answers a big fat NO, but as someone completely new to this, I definitely need some help from the community if possible.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Just to explain me, we have limited development resources, hence the question on here. I'm going to be taking over the Android side of things and should probably sign up for a one-week taster course (or something like that) but for now, I have our whole Android app on our hands with minimal comments, tests or instructions. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I also posted this question to Reddit and the best advice I was given was to add a '+' to the dependencies in build.gradle instead of version numbers. I've since tried this and feel like it might not be the solution I need. This is because I feel that the live application wouldn't be working if this were the issue. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In short, I feel like my local version of the application might not be working because I have some settings in Kotlin/Android studio somewhere that I need to change.....Any suggestions you can provide RE what these settings may be would be a huge help! </p>&#xA;

How to enforce an empty, non-null String in Kotlin? <p>I often want to hold a string that can not be null <strong>or blank</strong> - whitespace isn't good enough. The compiler handles  nicely to prevent null, and we can use  to check if it is null or blank. However, this requires that the blank check be handled everywhere it is used then handle errors if it is blank, which can cause unexpected errors if you miss a spot.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there an easier way to define a type or extension to  that will enforce that the string must not be blank?</p>&#xA;

AspectJ Compiler problems with kotlin delegation in type hierarchy <p><strong>NOTICE</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>TLDR; I discovered that this was simply an environmental problem.

Type interference issue with the WebFlux WebTestClient and Kotlin <p>I'm building a prototype for a new application using Spring Webflux and Kotlin. Spring Webflux contains a WebTestClient for unit tests. According to the documentation I should be able to test the results of a REST call like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, I'm running into some type interference issues. The problem is in the combination of 'expectBody' and 'isEqualTo'. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The error I get is: </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The used methods have the following signatures:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Sadly I'm running into the limits of my knowledge of generics and the differences between Kotlin and Java which means that I'm not sure how I should specify this.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Edit: Like I said below, it compiles when I use .

This seems to be because the 'isEqualTo' method returns a value, which is now defined as the 'Nothing' type.</p>&#xA;

Kotlin: appendText and closing resources <p>I'm new to Kotlin, but I have a strong Java background (Java is my day job). I'm loving some of the shortcut functions in Kotlin.

If I was to use a writer, I would do something like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But I don't see any thing directly on the appendText method that indicates closing resources.

Updating collection-based Widget RemoteViews after AsyncTask callback <p>I'm in a situation where the elements of my Widget's ListView are reliant on content fetched over the network via an AsyncTask. The code for getViewAt in my RemoteViewsFactory implementation is as follows:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And the AsyncTask is defined as an inner class</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>My basic train of thought is that I should perform the rendering of some default layout to the RemoteViews and return that to be inserted into the list, then allow the network operations to take place in the background. I then make modifications in the onPostExecute method of the AsyncTask on the same instance of RemoteViews, which I believe should in theory result in the actual list element being updated. However, despite the onPostExecute being run and the view being populated with its initial layout, the image is never set. Does anybody have any thoughts on how to achieve this? </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Afterthought: I've tried just using a TextView and setting some static text in the AsyncTask and that also does not work.</p>&#xA;

Suppress \Use property access syntax\ for method or class <p>In my project, I have a delegate(written in Java) for fetching data by RPC, most of it methods start with 'get' and some require no parameters, so Kotlin suggests to replace calls to them with property access syntax while they are not fulfilling property semantics (well, because they perform network requests), so I'd like to suppress all such inspections for all these methods usages by default and not in place of every call (yes, I'm aware of  annotation for blocks, and it works exactly opposite to what I need). </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there any solution for this except renaming them so they won't start with 'get'?</p>&#xA;
Can't catch exception throwing after Kotlin coroutine is cancelled <p>Using <a href=\https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>kotlinx.coroutines</a> lib I can't catch an exception if it was thrown after coroutine is canceled. This leads to app crash. </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>}</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Running this functions on Android produces the following log output</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Seems to be calling  throws  which is caught successfully. But the subsequent  is not caught. I suppose the following exceptions after the job is canceled should be ignored by the lib? Or how I can cancel job silently without throwing a  exception?</p>&#xA;
Assert Variable is not Null <p>I have a Variable with type </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In a Function I check it for being  and want to use it afterwards without always having to  every call. In e.g. Kotlin the IDE recognizes a check like that and asserts that the variable cannot be  afterwards. Is there a way to do this in C#?</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>When using </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>instead it works <strong>in this case</strong> because  doesn't have nullsafety at all. However, considering that this would compile even without the null check and just produce an error, the general question still remains. How can one persuade C# that a former nullable variable isn't nullable any more?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Edit 2</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Casting DateTime on the Variable works. </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Still not as safe as in Kotlin, but similar enough.</p>&#xA;

Firebase SDK in Kotlin - onChildChanged not firing on first child in list <p>I'm developing a server side app using Kotlin for managing my list of web customers in Firebase. I've successfully added the Java Firebase Admin SDK to my Kotlin and have gotten a functional connection with my Realtime Database.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, I just noticed one problem. I added a ChildEventListener for listening to changes to their data, and it works nice on every customer but the first one in the list. No matter if I order the data or no with \orderBy\, the first queried item never receives a ChildChanged callback when actually edited in the database.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I thought there could be some problem with the data in my customers, so it crashed without even throwing an exception, but even after adding a  single println for checking a ChildChanged callback was fired, it doesn't do a thing with the first customer in the list!</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I've done a similar code in the past for Java (without Kotlin) and they always worked great.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm using latest Firebase Java SDK version, 5.2.0.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Has anyone experienced a similar error?</p>&#xA;
Different return type in RxJava 2 (updating from RxJava1) <p>I am migrating our app from RxJava 1.x.x to RxJava 2.x.x. I have a problem with one of my method - it returns different return type. I had this method in version 1.x.x :</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>As you can see the result type is . In RxJava2, the nullable observables are not allowed. I solved this problem with Optional. I also replaced Observable classes with Flowable cause I need to manage Backpressure strategy.  It means that return type is changed from  to .&#xA;This is the changed method:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The problem is that now the required return type is wrapped to extra Single. So it looks like this: <br>&#xA;instead of . Do you have any idea how to remove that Single? I cannot change the return type.</p>&#xA;
Generated toString method to include members from base class? <p>I am trying to build a DTO (data-transfer-object) classes in Kotlin to be called from a Java application.  Given following code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><em>BaseDto.kt</em></p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p><em>DataObject.kt</em></p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p><em>Main.java</em></p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This displays:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I would like to include the <em>id</em> field form the BaseDto in the DataObject.toString call.  One option is to override the toString with ToStringBuilder.reflectionToString in DataObject.toSting, but it would have to be added to every object derived from BaseDto.  Is there a way to declare a data object hierarchy that automatically includes members from base classes.  This is doable in java by overriding toString() in the base and using the ToStringBuilder.reflectionToString, in Kotlin the base toString is not called since data object generates its own version of toString which does not call super. </p>&#xA;

Android onCheckedChangeListener bizzare behavior <p>So I am attempting to code some CheckBox logic for a page in which a user can +1 or -1 a specific entry. The first time my RecyclerViewAdapter is bound, I iterate through the list of votes and check if the user id is present, and if the vote value is +1 or -1 here</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Which works fine! If I previously voted +1 and reload, boom, the box is checked. The issue, however, comes when I then try to interact with the boxes again. If I hit the +1 box, the check remains and doesnt do anything. This also occurs for the -1 box. I also set my listeners for the CheckBoxes in the bindtask function like so  </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>It should also be worth mentioning that I have a socket listener in my fragment class that uses the adapter listening for a +1 and -1 event, in which case it updates the score of the item and notifys the adapter that the data set has changed, like here</p>&#xA;&#xA;<pre><code>private val onUpvote = Emitter.Listener { args -&gt;&#xA;    val data = args[0] as JSONObject&#xA;    var newScore: Int&#xA;    var updatedId: Int&#xA;    System.out.println(data)&#xA;    if(activity != null) {&#xA;        activity.runOnUiThread({&#xA;            try {&#xA;                newScore = data.getInt(\score\)&#xA;                updatedId = data.getInt(\id\)&#xA;                for (i in LUNCHVOTE_DESTINATIONS.size - 1 downTo 0) {&#xA;                    val destination = LUNCHVOTE_DESTINATIONS.get(i)&#xA;                    if(updatedId == destination.id) {&#xA;                        LUNCHVOTE_DESTINATIONS.get(i).score = newScore&#xA;

I have it working fine when all of my mustache template files have the extension .html, but the problem is that I don't get any IDE support.  IntelliJ IDEA has a plugin for mustache, but the extension has to be .mustache.  When I change the file extensions, though, I end up with a 404 error.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I've seen in the <a href=\https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-samples/spring-boot-sample-web-mustache/\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>official example</a> that they are using .mustache, so I know it's possible.  I couldn't find anything in that project to indicate that a setting was changed to enable this.

Using Kotlin WHEN clause for <, <=, >=, > comparisons <p>I'm trying to use the  clause with a  or  comparison.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This doesn't compile. Is there a way of using the normal set of boolean operators (&lt; &lt;=, >= >) in a comparison to enable this?</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I tried to find an unbounded range comparison, but couldn't make this work either? Is it possible to write this as an unbounded range?</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>You can put the whole expression in the second part, which is OK but seems like unnecessary duplication. At least it compiles and works.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But I'm not sure that is any simpler than the if-else alternative we have been doing for years. Something like:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Of course, real world problems are more complex than the above, and the  clause is attractive but doesn't work as I expect for this type of comparison.</p>&#xA;

What's the recommended way to deal with Singletons cleanup in Android (Kotlin)? <p>I have been having some weird issues in my Android app when closing it via back key and reentering, and found they are happening because variables in 2 Singleton classes I have are never re-initializing (The issue doesn't happen if manually killing the app from task manager).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Even after I call finish explicitly on Main activity onBackPressed and I can see onDestroy is called, the Singletons are still in memory.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I decided to do manual cleanup of these Singletons before destroying my Activity, the problem is using Kotlin I would need to make all their member variables nullable (?) and it would be a lot of hassle to remember to assign null to every variable, so for now I opted to handle the instantiation of the Singleton like this and just make null the whole instance while cleaning:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Client use:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>These seems more involved than it should, and I know this is not even thread safe, but keep in mind that simply using the 'object' keyword instead of 'class' will not work, as it will prevent any initialization taking place the second time I run the app (the constructor is not being called again and I can't force destroy the instance).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This makes me think it might be worth looking into Android dependency injection but I feel like at least one of my Singletons really needs to be accessed on a lot of places so it might not be an elegant solution either (Probably need to refactor it into smaller functionalities).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The main issue here is the way android handles destruction but I guess I can't change that, I don't see any reason why it keeps all the static values of non activity classes if the application activities are already destroyed.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The question is how do you deal with this cases regardless of the language used? or what do you think are the best practices in this case?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Edit: Actually I just did a test with Dagger 2, and the same problem happens, if I use @Provides and @Singleton, the values of member variables on the provided object the second time launching the app are not null so I guess this needs to be dealt with explicitly unless I am missing some more annotations to tell Dagger that the instance should be released at the end of the app life-cycle.</p>&#xA;

I assume this might be related to the controller and how JavaFX/TornadoFX works, but I can't seem to find what I'm doing wrong.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The issue itself occurs in <a href=\https://github.com/sigmadeltasoftware/APT-InItFX/blob/feature/APTFX-3-Create-system-details-view/src/main/kotlin/be/sigmadelta/aptinitfx/presentation/systemdetails/SystemDetailsViewProxy.kt\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>this class</a>, and happens in the  method. What I would expect to happen is that upon pressing the \System Details\ button in the sidebar, the labels would update to the required value, but this isn't happening for some reason. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Please feel free to point me to what I'm doing wrong, or provide any constructive criticism. The project is still in full development so a lot of things are still messy/broken.</p>&#xA;

How to pass string array to android email intent <p>I'm trying to send an email programmatically in kotlin.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here's my code, which I translated from a java example I found on the Web.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>It seems to work correctly, except that the \TO\ field isn't copied into the user's email app.  The java code said:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>and the android developer <a href=\https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-common.html\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>docs</a> say that Intent.EXTRA_EMAIL is \A string array of all \To\ recipient email addresses.\  How should I define the  variable?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>EDIT: I've discover that if I hard code my email address, </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>then the app works as expected.  When I get to the email app, my address is in the \To:\ field, and I can send mail to myself.  If, however, the I type the same address in the program, it doesn't show up in the email client.  Moreover, when I look at it under the debugger, the intent shows exactly the same values both ways.

Are Kotlin data types built off primitive or non-primitive Java data types? <p>I am new to Kotlin and was playing around with the data types. I took an  type and then tried to cast it as a  by saying , a call that is valid in java (non syntactically but you get the point). However, this failed, saying that Int cannot be cast to Double. I am assuming this is because it is built off the Integer class rather than the raw int data type. Am I correct, and what is the most efficient way to cast values? There is a  function, but this seems inefficient and unwieldy. </p>&#xA;

Multiple retrofit2 requests using Flowable in Kotlin <p>In order to improve my skills in kotlin, Rx, Retrofit2 I've decided to do a demo project.&#xA;The demo project consist to display posts in a recycler view then display details of the post in a detail activity.<br>&#xA;I've encountered difficulties displaying data coming from different api call: the user name, the title, the body of the post and the number of comments of the post.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My problem is that I would like to do multiple request and then have all the data needed in order to display them in the detail activity.

How to query Realm on background Thread using RxJava2 <p>I want to read/query and transform Realm data on a background thread using RxJava2.

Android Room, adding library data classes to database <p>There is a shared library that is used by a desktop application as well as an android application.  The shared library contains no android libraries.  The shared library contains a set of data classes.  I would like to annotate these data classes as Room @Entity and add them to a database on the android client.  The desktop application has no need of a database.  Is there an easy way to do this?  The only option I can think of so far is to: change the classes from data classes (since data classes cannot be extended).  then extend these classes only in the android application and add the annotations.  </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Edit: Another way to ask this is, what can be done if there is a (possibly non-open) POJO in another library that wants to be added in Room?</p>&#xA;

Using EventBus to finish an Activity from Base Activity? <p>Working on an existing project, I found this rather uncommon piece of implementation (to me at least).

Implementing search that pushes results to list as soon as they become available using rxJava <p>I need to implement a search on a large data set that can take some time to complete on mobile devices.

onNext() never gets called on a PublishSubject <p>I am trying to build a presenter that calculates some events within some time period, shows a loading only the first time of loading, and updates the ui when it is done. Because the events can be updated via multiple ways (such as user preferences) I need to be able to tell the presenter that the events were updated and that it has to refresh them again. Here is what I have right now:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The subject is a  of Int.

Is it possible to avoid code repetition when an object should return a modified copy of itself? <p>I'm currently writing some classes that represent symbolic mathematical expressions. All of these are immutable.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, I found myself often repeating the same kind of structure, so I created an interface to avoid repetition, but find myself unable to avoid duplicating the \substituteInside\ method (see below), which returns a copy of the object with components corresponding to \find\ replaced with \replace\.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This behavior is the same for all instances of this interface.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In my current solution, the interface requires implementing a method  which returns the modified copy of the object.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The interface can then be implemented as follows: these classes represent the operation of getting some component of an expression.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This improves things as other methods returning a copy of the object can use that method and thus can live in the interface, but I still have to copy this method everywhere, while it basically always does the same thing.</p>&#xA;

What is an equivalent of private static final field in Kotlin? <p>Actually the question is, which approach is better and which convention do you use? </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>E.g. in order to improve readability we've added this field in Java class:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now the better approach is to use companion object:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>or and  outside the class:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>or maybe do you use different approaches?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>And the additional question is, if we use the second convention, should we use camel case or uppercase with underscore?

Best practices for Data mapper on Android (Kotlin and Java) <p>I'm struggling trying to find the best way to structure the mapping of my WS classes that represents JSON objects that I get from the rest client to Realm objects to save it on local database, and vice versa when I need to send a post to server.&#xA;It is a structuring problem actually, I don't know if I should create a GlobalMapper that maps all those models (it's 26 models as of yet). Or if I should create a package mapper and create a mapper for each model. Or using extension functions inside Kotlin model classes and WS classes inside companion objects and static functions on those model and ws java classes.&#xA;So I would like suggestions on how you guys would achieve that. </p>&#xA;

Firebase requests never complete on Android <p>I am currently building a native android app in Kotlin with Android Studio 3 (Canary). I am also utilizing Firebase Realtime Database and Firebase Auth. Here are my gradle dependecies:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Everything worked fine until communication with my Firebase Database stopped completing. I don't get any errors but all Listeners I have registerd are not being triggerd anymore. For example:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The  statement is never reached.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is some Logger output, which I belive is related. It looks to me like all WebSocket connection attempts time out and are therefore retried. This output repeats over and over again:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But if I'm right, what is causing this problem? I haven't found any similar issues googling.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I ran the code both on a physical device and in the emulator. I have a web client connected to the same database, which is still working though, so I guess it's not a server-side problem.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The worst thing ist, I reset my project to a point were it used to work but that did not help. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I know this is not much information but I don't know how to further analyse the problem.</p>&#xA;

How to avoid partial coverage with lateinit fields in Kotlin <p>I have an Android service written in Kotlin which I inject using Guice.

Can I update a deeply nested immutable object without making it aware of its context? <p>Let's imagine I have a nested immutable object graph, along these lines (using Kotlin syntax, but hopefully it's clear):</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now, I want to switch the kettle on. If the objects were mutable I would just write:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But because they are immutable I have to write:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>(Actually, it's slightly more complicated, but this pseudo-code will do).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I don't like this, not because it's long, per se, but because the Kettle now needs to know not just about its own internal state, but about the full context it exists in.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How can I rewrite this so that each object can be responsible for providing its own mutation logic, without having to be aware of the full object graph? Or am I just trying to marry object-oriented and functional concepts in an impossible way?</p>&#xA;

Kotlin Cast String as String.Companion <p>So I'm new to learning Kotlin, coming from a C# background. I've been messing around with types and a few other things. I'm trying to create a static class of \WalMartGreeters\ that can add greeters to a list, and then call a simple static function to display those. My method(s) takes a string argument/string list to add to the mutable string list but when I attempt to add values to it. I get a pre-compilation error saying \expected String.Companion\ \got String\ I attempt to change it to cast the String as a String.Companion and then it says the cast is illegal. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The predominant error I get is: Exception in thread \main\ java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.String cannot be cast to kotlin.jvm.internal.StringCompanionObject</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;

Firebase database always offline, when tested on physical Android device <p>I am building a native Android application in <strong>Android Studio 3</strong>, which makes use of Firebase Database and Firebase Auth.

Split algorithm and view part using a Strategy Pattern in Kotlin <p>This is the code I would like to refactor:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>As you can see I am downloading data in an array called match. Then I parse the same array obtaining an array of keys (keysArray). Then I add a specific element of the keys array to another array (requestsUser).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Considering that this algorithm could be changed I would like to incapsulate the algorithm part in another class. I read somewhere that in these kind of situation the best thing to do is to use a Strategy Pattern, but I am working in kotlin. How could I implement a Strategy Pattern in Kotlin?</p>&#xA;

Don't call setOnClickListener for an AdapterView <p>I'm trying to close some custom softkeyboard, whenever a listview is clicked.

The following line</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Results in an exception, telling me to</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The Listview is wrapped in an LinearLayout. If I set the listener on this LinearLayout, it does not receive any click events.

The click on the background should work as well.</p>&#xA;

It seems to me that it should be declared as  but that doesn't compile. However, if I think of  as \you can only read from, or return, it\ and  as \you can only write, or assign a value, to it\, then it makes sense. Can someone explain?</p>&#xA;

Extremely slow in autocompletion & code analysis for Kotlin projects in Intellij IDEA <p>We have a project on IDEA that consists of a couple med sized Java packages and one very small Kotlin package (5 files). I noticed performance is fine with any Java packages, but it's 10x slower in autocompletion, code analysis and compilation for the very small Kotlin package. Autocompletion occasionally was so slow to a point where the popover couldn't load all the methods and it had to load a couple API incrementally. Every time our developer types a word and wait for autocomplete, it takes about 2-5 seconds for the expected autocomplete to show up. Sometimes autocomplete was too slow to show anything, and we had to cancel the word and retyped it and waited. Same slowness occurs in code analysis. This is significantly impacting my team's productivity. From our research, it appears this is a well-known long lasting issue. This also happens for our another small project. I was wondering what we can do to fix this? Thanks.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Kotlin plugin is latest, Version: 1.1.3-release-IJ2017.2-2&#xA;Intellij is also on latest version, 2017 2.1 (built on July 31 2017)</p>&#xA;

Flow textview around image <p>I've spent hours looking for answer and have really no idea how to solve it.

Kotlin Unit Test Always passes when run from Android Studio UI <p>I'm trying to implement some Unit Tests with Kotlin in my application.

Is there a way to solve it?&#xA;Even this test passes when run from the UI</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;

Kotlin JPA Encapsulate OneToMany <p>I am using JPA with Kotlin and coming against an issue trying to encapsulate a OneToMany relationship. This is something I can easily achieve in Java but having some issues due to Kotlin only having properties and no fields in classes. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have an order, and an order has one to many line items. The order object has a MutableList of LineItem BUT the get method SHOULD NOT return a mutable list, or anything that the caller could potentially modify, as this breaks encapsulation. The order class should be responsible for managing collection of line items and ensuring all business rules / validations are met.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is the code I've come up with thus far. Basically I'm using a backing property which is the MutableList which Order class will mutate, and then there is a transient property which returns Iterable, and  ensure that even if caller gets the list, and cast it to MutableList they won't be able to modify it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there a better way to enforce encapsulation and integrity. Perhaps I'm just being too defensive with my design and approach. Ideally no one should be using the getter to get and modify the list, but hey it happens.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;

How to set default BottomNavigationView tab in Kotlin? <p>I have been trying to set my default selected tab using the widely accepted java method in my onCreate (bottomNavigationView.setSelectedItemId(R.id.item_id)) but this does not seem to work in Kotlin. Also, the fragments that are set to load on each selected item seem to load every time that menu item is selected, as well as drawing their contents over the previous fragment.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How can I set the default selected tab for my BottomNavigationView? Also am I correctly loading fragments or is my code not properly disposing of fragments before loading another one?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>MainActivity.kt</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;

Kotlin class instance assert not correct <p>I'm converting a Java project into Kotlin.  I've converted a  object into Kotlin and when I run the existing JUnit tests in Java I'm getting a error between two instances of the Kotlin  object.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>User.kt:</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>TestUtil.java</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The  test fails, as I believe in Java comparison is not done correctly on the Kotlin class.

The same test case is used for other Java classes, so it has to work for both Java and Kotlin classes.</p>&#xA;

Make Kotlin warn on assignment of flexible/platform type to non-null type? <p>When calling a non-nullability-annotated Java function from Kotlin, we get flexible-typed return values, denoted by exclamation marks, e.g. .</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Kotlin silently allows assigning these flexible values to a normal non-null type, e.g. , which can cause NullPointerExceptions at runtime.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I would prefer to get compiler warnings or errors for such assignments.

Spring Boot insert invalid datetime into MariaDB results in null, on not nullable field <p>I have a problem in a Spring Boot project, where I have a table created like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>and the entity like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I also have an endpoint which takes a Task as parameter, where Jackson converts it from JSON to a Task Object, which works fine looking at debug logs.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So the problem is that if I give a date which is outside the legal range(eg. above the year 9999), hibernate persists it without error, but the field ends up containing null, which shouldn't be possible when it's a not nullable field.

I \fixed it\ but indeed it was a false positive.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So I clicked to \fix it\ and it removed the dependency of my test-folder from the source-folder, however now all my test classes give me the \Unresolved reference\ error. How do I revert it? Or maybe, how do I add the dependency again?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>That's an image to understand better the issue <a href=\https://i.stack.imgur.com/kCPyn.jpg\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\><img src=\https://i.stack.imgur.com/kCPyn.jpg\ alt=\enter image description here\></a></p>&#xA;
The label does not denote a loop in forEach <p>I am continuing from a loop in Kotlin but I get the warning from the studio that the label does not denote a loop. Could someone tell me what's wrong in the syntax? </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here is the code segment </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;
Kotlin generate constructor that sets default values to nulled arguments <p>Let's take the class of a data class:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>When calling this function from Kotlin, it is pretty straightforward. I can simply use the named-argument syntax to do so. Calling from Java, I have to specify all values, or use the  annotation, which generates the following constructors (in addition to the constructor that kotlin generates with the bit-mask for default values):</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Now, if I want to create a  object in Java equivalent to  I can't do it with the above constructors. I CAN however do it if I put  at the end in the  declaration (the generation of constructors seems to depend on the order the optional arguments are defined in). Which is fine, because expecting kotlin to generate all permutations is going to heavily bloat some classes.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The biggest problem that tools like  simply don't work as they have no idea which constructor to use (and not like I can annotate one of the generated ones specially).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So, is there a way to generate a (single) constructor like:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Currently I am using the above approach, but manually defining the constructors where I need them.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I should clarify, creating a similar constructor doesn't work, obviously because both the signatures would clash on the JVM. This is what it would like in my case:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also note the redundancy where I have to write the default values for the properties twice. I Now that I look at it, I doubt there exists a solution for this. Maybe this is a good use-case for a  based side-project of mine :)</p>&#xA;
Android - Kotlin : return value in async fun <p>I would like to ask if it's possible to 'return' a value from a function&#xA;if the function doing AsyncTask? </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>For example : </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The problem in this function is that the AsyncTask is not finish yet so i get a wrong value from the function ,any idea how to solve it?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>is using a interface is the only why or there is a compilation handler like in Swift ?</p>&#xA;
Validating large XML files against large XSDs, is there a quick way to do this? <p>I'm trying to quickly validate large XML documents against large XSD's. The XML can be anywhere between 500 to 39000 lines long, and the XSD's are in the region of 2000 - 3000 lines.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The result so far has been horribly slow performance, the initialization of the parser with such large XSDs can take up to 30 seconds, however, this is fine as we can do this once and then just inject it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But, when it comes to actually using this to validate the XML, depending on the implementation it can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is really odd as a command line tool called xmllint:&#xA;&#xA;Is able to do the same job but finishes instantly.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I've tried the JDOM library, the SAXReader method and I've settled on the jdom2 stuff, here's how I'm constructing it:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And here's the parsing in action:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The builder.build part is the line that needs to be borderline instant.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In terms of the desired solution, I don't mind using C, Kotlin, whatever as long as the output is sensible to read and quick.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thanks</p>&#xA;

Kotlin constructor delegation to inner data class? <p>We have an abstract Java class (which we can't modify) called  that we want to implement in Kotlin.

This has lead us to the following implementation:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This class will always be used from Java and currently you can instantiate it like this (Java):</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>But we'd prefer to instantiate it like this instead:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I can of course change the Kotlin code to something like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>but this is very verbose and kind of defeats the purpose of using Kotlin.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What I think I'd like to do is something like this (pseudo code):</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>(note the  in the  constructor which obviously doesn't work)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I.e. I'd like to somehow destruct or delegate the constructor of MyClass to take the same arguments as MyClassData without duplicating them.

kotlin-js extending kotlinx html classes <p>I have tried to learn the Kotlin language this week and wanted to make a simple class that acts as an html element.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>At first, I saw the org.w3c.dom library's \HTMLElement\ and its chidlren, but extending those is more of a pain than anything I have ever seen in my life.&#xA;The problem with it is that it is abstract and has about 20 members I have to implement, provide the logic and hope I do it correctly.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Then I used the kotlinx.html library to create normal divs and other elements, so I thought \I can extend those\.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>A good thing was that it wasnt abstract, so I dont have to do shit and it works right?&#xA;Well... not that fast, I have to provide 2 parameters for the only constructor it has. As I haven't found any documentation of it as searching anything in the range of \kotlinx html div constructor\ to \chuck norris\ all result in similar topics to the following:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Which is nice, but not what I want.&#xA;The first parameter is pretty easy to understand from the constructor's declaration as it is named \initialAttributes\ so I'd assume that would be 'class=\my-class\ id=\myId\, style=\display:none;\' etc. providing it an empty HashMap would be sufficient for my case.

How to differentiate between a bound callable member reference and a function of the same type in kotlin? <p>When it comes to a method signature or definition, is there any way to differentiate</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>and</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>? That is, to specify that a bound member reference is required and not a function instance, or vice versa. Here is the signature of the above example:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>On the same note, is it possible to differentiate between a constructor reference and a function which just returns a type? E.g.  vs.  (without kotlin.reflect, if possible)</p>&#xA;
Tornadofx: Given that I have a (target) node from an event how do I get the text attribute? <p>I am new to both Kotlin and Tornadofx.

Android LiveData Observer not active after first update <p>I'm trying out a basic implementation of Architecture Component's Live Data with Kotlin like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>My ViewModel class is created like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And My Repository:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>}</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>And all of this works great and UI is updated as it should but only for the first time.

Kotlin's crossinline keyword <p>I have read <a href=\https://stackoverflow.com/q/38827186/780350\>this question</a> but I have a more fundamental question regarding the  keyword.  I'm not really sure what problem it is solving and how it solves it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>From <a href=\https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/inline-functions.html#non-local-returns\ rel=\noreferrer\>the Kotlin Docs</a>,</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>[Emphasis added]</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This statement is ambiguous to me.  First, I am having trouble actually picturing what is meant by \such cases\.  I have a general idea of what the issue is but can't come up with a good example of it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Second, the phrase \To indicate that,\ can be read multiple ways.  To indicate what?  That <em>a particular case</em> is not allowed?  That it <em>is</em> allowed?  That non-local control flow in a given function definition is (or is not) allowed?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In short, I have trouble figuring out what the context for using this really is, what using it communicates to clients, and what the expected results of applying this keyword are.</p>&#xA;

Java 2 minute delay sometimes when connecting socket? <p>I'm baffled with the following mystery. When testing my application, I frequently (maybe 25% of the time) get a two minute delay when connecting an SSL socket. I'm using Java 8, Ubuntu 16.04. When I use wireshark I can see that nothing is sent over the network to the target server. Maybe there could be other network traffic like DNS resolving. The delay is always 2 minutes with an uncertainty of no more than a couple seconds. The last log message before it hangs is:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Pausing in a debugger verifies that it's blocked in socket connect code in class PlainSocketImpl:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm pretty sure I'd have noticed if this hang happens to other applications, I think it just affects my Java program. My (Kotlin) code is as follows:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The last clue I have to offer is that the time spent paused in the debugger doesn't count towards the two minutes. I can wait five minutes with it paused, unpause it and it will still take exactly two minutes. That tells me it's not waiting for an external process to complete because the external process would make progress during the paused time.</p>&#xA;

Break out of an anonymous function in kotlin <p>Created a test case to try and represent what I'm trying to do. I can't figure out how to \stop\ continuing to do work inside of an anonymous function.

What is the purpose of having bound class reference return a covariant type? <p>I'm playing with reflection and I came out with this problem. When using bound class reference via the  syntax, I get a covariant KClass type:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>As I could learn from the docs, this will return the exact type of the object, in case it is instance of a subtype of , hence the variance modifier.&#xA;However this prevents retrieving properties declared in the  class and getting their value (which is what I'm trying to do)</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>I found that a solution is using  extension function on the object reference, to get instead the invariant type:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This way, I get both the exact type at runtime and the possibility to consume the type. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Interestingly, if I use a supertype instead of a generic, with the latter method I still get access to the correct type, without the need of variance:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>If I got it correct,  is equal to calling the java , which returns a variant type with a wildcard, while  is a  with a cast to the specific type.&#xA;Still, I don't get why would I ever need a covariant KClass, when it limits me to only produce the type, given that there are other ways to access the exact class at runtime and use it freely, and I wonder if the more immediate  should return an invariant type by design.</p>&#xA;

kotlin setter infinte recursion <p>I am testing out kotlin on Android and ran into a problem where the setters of two variables get called in an infinte recursion because they try to change each other when they are originally set.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here is a sample code</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And say I then use the following code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>It ends up causing an infinte recursions and eventually a stackoverflow. The setter for  calls the setter for  which in turn calls the setter for  again. And it goes on for ever.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I want to be able to update the value for  whenever  is set, but also update the value of  whenever  is set. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Any thoughts from the Kotlin experts out there? Would I need to make Java like setters in this case so that my setter code doesn't get called whenever I assign a value to  or . Or is there some nifty Kotlin goodness that I can use?</p>&#xA;

Odd TestObserver behaviour when subscribing to a Subject <p>Consider the following <em>RxJava 2</em> snippet in <em>Kotlin</em>:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>From my understanding,  should be able to receive  after waiting on statement <strong>5</strong> and the assertion on statement <strong>6</strong> should succeed.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>However, what actually happens is: <strong>5</strong> blocks until it times out because no value is received and the assertion on <strong>6</strong> fails.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also, if I put a breakpoint on <strong>3</strong> and just resume the execution after it pauses, everything will work. Looks like a threading problem.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I'm clearly missing something here. What would be the correct way to consume a hot observable?</p>&#xA;

Store data in BEAN (Spring Boot REST) <p>I am creating a REST API with Spring Boot. Most of the data come from a database but some data is fetched from third-party APIs. The problem is some of them have access limitations like max 10 requests per minute or something.&#xA;Now I am looking for a method to cache the data in my spring application and only update it every few seconds. Storing it in the db and updating it every 10 seconds is a little bit too much since the fetched data is about 1000 rows. So I thought I simply store it in my service bean.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is my approach so far. (Coded in Kotlin)</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>It works but it seems kinda hacky to me. Not really a clean solution, is it? &#xA;If someone has a better approach to this I would be very thankful.</p>&#xA;
standalone scenebuilder to get intellij project <p>Okay, I may get responses to read the manual - I did review and did google searches and I am just not seeing it.&#xA;I have created a UI using a standalone Scenebuilder. I have a working Kotlin code in intellij. Basically all I want to do is getting what I created from the standalone Scenebuilder to intellij in my Kotlin project so that I can connect them. Get my Kotlin code that works at on the command prompt to give it some life in a GUI. I am still in the learning stages of programming in Kotlin and using Scenebuilder (standalone).</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If anyone can point me on where I would find how to provide this connectivity, I would really appreciate it -- thank you!</p>&#xA;

RxJava different output between Flowable and Observable with Window and Groupby <p>I'm using RxJava2 with code that boils down to something like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>When I use  it works fine, but with  there is no output.

Return value of if/else condition, but also run code <p>I'm a newbie to Kotlin, but I freaking love it. There's a wonderful feeling when you can turn three lines of code into one. Now I often find myself looking at my code and thinking \there's some redundancy here. There should be a more concise way to do it.\ And when I do some searching, often Kotlin does provide a more succinct way.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Here's a problem where I FEEL there should be a simple, concise Kotlin solution, but am not aware of it. Hopefully you can enlighten me!</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Take code like this contrived example:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Based on an  condition, I want to run some code and then return the value of the condition. It just bothers me that I have to explicitly say \if the condition is true, return . If it is false, return .\ It seems redundant. Of course, I could say , but I want to run code based on if it is true.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Is there a magic operator Kotlin has that I don't know about? Should I make a function to handle this situation for me, although the syntax of calling that would be different than an if statement? Is there some kind of mapping function, or some way to overload if? It seems like there should be a concise, clever answer, but it's not coming to me.</p>&#xA;
Return empty result in requery QueryRecyclerAdapter <p>I'm using  to display database request result in .

The crash happens just before  in the following code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>App build.gradle</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The message in Logs is  without anything else before or after. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>It's the first app I develop for Android, so could someone help me understand what is going on and how can I fix this crash? Is it the API 17 to blame (but there is no warning of API specific functions in app), kotlins coroutines, HUAWEI device?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Error Stack Trace</strong> as requested in comments</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;

Retrofit API call: How to make sure that value is not null after making api call? <p>I have below AuthenticationResponse model that I use for 3 api calls using retrofit2.

The other 2 calls only contain attributes for \resetSuccesful\ or the other 4.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How can I make sure/check that when I receive the response to the verifyEmail call f.e. that it contains a non null value for validEmail??</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Service:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Model:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<hr>&#xA;&#xA;<p>edit:&#xA;If i mock my server response to return f.e. responseCode = 200 - { \validEmail\: null } and change validEmail type to Boolean (instead of Boolean?)

kotlin, java, nativescript or xamarin for android development <p>I am planning to develop an <strong>enterprise level application for android</strong> which may or may not be made for ios and windows later. Currently I am a UWP developer and I have lot of experience with <strong>c# and xaml</strong> hence I opted to learn <strong>xamarin</strong> in order to build my new application. I have zero knowledge or experience in <strong>android</strong> uptil now.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>XAMARIN</strong> : I thought to learn it but after some searching on internet I found out it will not give as good experience and efficiency as a app created with <strong>java</strong> because my app will have native APIs required like google maps and live location on <strong>maps</strong> within the app etc. So I decided to leave it for now and move towards java.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>JAVA</strong> : I already have a little bit knowledge of java so its not totally new to me but honestly I hate using it and I prefer c# a lot.so after some research I found out about this new language , i.e: <strong>kotlin</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Kotlin</strong>: I see tht kotlin solves a lot of common problems of java language. But does it have big enough community for a new developer in android like myself?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>NativeScript</strong>: I also have some experience with web technologies and I know about nativescript which can be used to create native cross platform mobile applications,and it is supposed to be native totally and not run within a <strong>webview</strong>.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>**Suggestion ** : The reason I am confused with which language to start my android development career is hopefully clear to you as of now. So I need some honest suggestions about which technology to prefer, considering my specific needs? the basic needs for my app are following.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<ol>&#xA;<li>social media network type app.</li>&#xA;<li>will require google maps deeply integrated like in <strong>uber</strong></li>&#xA;<li>will require connection with a backend server ofcourse for database and other web services.</li>&#xA;<li>I want and prefer to use the brilliant <strong>material design</strong> for UI of my app.</li>&#xA;<li>My app will use <strong>wifi</strong> and **dataConnection (4g, 3g ) ** as well.</li>&#xA;<li>I want my app to be efficient and fast considering the factors above.</li>&#xA;<li>It will probably and most likely be on uwp platform and also ios platform as well in future.</li>&#xA;<li>I plan to use <strong>Microsoft Azure</strong> for any kind of server related web services.</li>&#xA;<li>I like to use open source 3rd party libraries for both UI and code behind for my apps.</li>&#xA;</ol>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;

Clean Architecture: Use different model classes for different data sources? <p>I am currently developing a news feed android app. I try to design my app according to the principles of clean architecture. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>In the data layer I am using the repository pattern as a facade for the diferent data sources: remote data from an API (<a href=\https://newsapi.org/\ rel=\nofollow noreferrer\>https://newsapi.org/</a>) , local data from an DB (Realm or SQLite) as well as some in-memory cache.<br>&#xA;In my domain layer I have defined some immutable model classes (Article, NewsSource, etc.) which are being used by the domain layer as well as the presentation layer (no need for extra model classes in the presentation layer in my opinion). </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Does it make sense to use different model classes for the remote data source as well as for the local data source?</strong> </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>E.g. The remote data source uses Retrofit to make API calls and the models need to be annotated in order to be parsed by GSON.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>The models for the local data source also may have to fulfill some certain contract like models in a Realm DB need to extend RealmObject.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Obviously, I don´t want my domain models to be 'polluted' by any data source specific contract (annotations, RealmObject inheritance, etc.). So I thought it would make sense to use different models for different data sources and the repository handles the mapping between them. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>E.g. We want to fetch all articles from the remote API, store them in the local DB and return them to the domain layer.</strong> </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Flow would be like:</strong> &#xA;Remote data source makes http request to news api and retrieves a list of ´s. The repository would map these models to a Domain specific article model (). Then these would be mapped to DB models (e.g. ) and inserted into the DB. Finally the list of ´s would be returned to the caller.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Two questions arise:</strong> &#xA;The above example shows how <em>many allocations</em> there would be using this approach. &#xA;For every article that is going to be downloaded and inserted into the DB, three models would be created in that process. Would that be overkill?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Also, I know that the data layer should use different model classes than the domain layer (inner layer should no nothing about outer layer). But how would that make sense in the above example. I would already have two different model classes for the two different data sources. Adding a third one that´s being used as a 'mediator' model by the data-layer/repository to handle mapping to other models (remote, local, domain) would add even more allocations. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>So should the data layer know nothing about domain models and let the domain do the mapping from a data layer model to a domain layer model?</strong> </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Should there be a generic model used only by the repository/data-layer?</strong></p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Thank, I really appreciate any help from more experienced developers :)</p>&#xA;

Using range in zipWith also emits all items from range sequence before zipper function applied <p>The question is about RxJava2. </p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Noticed that zipping  that comes from  with  emits all items from  before zipper function has been applied.

\Property type is not a subtype of overridden abstract val\ on multiple-inherited field <p>Sometimes, a type is declared to implement 2 interfaces which both have an abstract property the same name, but when I moved the bounded type argument to a top-level abstract superclass and subclass it in different objects, the class overriding the the abstract property on both superinterfaces fails to compile when using type arguments for a subclass.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>The generated interfaces and abstract class:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>An example of the generated object which overrides 2 superinterface properties with the same name: </p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>And then the interfaces for the API:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>In order to have polymorphism for different fields on types implementing an interface yet requiring different arguments so I can declare them like this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>(There's a separate set of interfaces for  for a field like  in the example but I left that out for brevity)</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>What am I doing incorrectly?

Kotlin and idiomatic way to write, 'if not null, else...' based around mutable value <p>Suppose we have this code:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Unlike in Java, where you could be left alone to worry about null dereferencing at runtime, this doesn't compile - quite rightly.

Without using any new Kotlin language features, the simplest way is obviously to copy the value to a method-scope one that won't subsequently change.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>There's this:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>This has the obvious disadvantage that you need to return early or otherwise avoid executing the subsequent code - OK in certain, small contexts, but has a smell to it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Then there's this possibility:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>but whilst it has greater clarity of purpose, arguably it's more unwieldy and verbose than the Java-style way of dealing with this.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Am I missing anything, and is there a preferred idiom with which to achieve this?</p>&#xA;

To update modes now I just need to:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p><strong>Option #2.</strong> Just throw away all Kotlin's stuff and use \Java approach\.</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>To access modes in this case I need to:</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;<p>Maybe the second approach is cleaner and has less lines of code, but the first one looks more \Kotlin-style\: we have a property and separate setter/getter for it.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>So what's the correct way to achieve the behavior described above from the <strong>ideological</strong> point of view in Kotlin? May be you can suggest your own correct option (it would be nice, by the way).</p>&#xA;

Using phone to simulate butterfly net, determining positioning of the net <p>In Kotlin I am working on a program where the user moves their phone to control a virtual butterfly net.  The positional information is sent to an  and the UI application will get the data.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>My problem is accurately showing the position.  If the phone is the net part of the catcher, then ideally as you move the phone, using the accelerometer I should know which direction you are moving, and can send that data.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Nice in theory, harder in practice.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>This is my code, but the last four points isn't giving me enough information for my approach.  I would like to basically determine the direction in 3 dimensions and the acceleration, so I am creating a vector.  Then when the direction changes, and the force, I could go with a new vector.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>But, I am not accurately getting the information, and then I should just send it as (x,y,z) in one packet, and the UI could then take that and translate the net to the new location.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I am trying to adjust based on the orientation of the phone, in the beginning section.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>How do I accurately track the positional information?</p>&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;
