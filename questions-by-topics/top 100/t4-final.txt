This Handler class should be static or leaks might occur: IncomingHandler This Handler class should be static or leaks might occur:AsyncQueryHandler This AsyncTask class should be static or leaks might occur (anonymous android.os.AsyncTask) The warning is due to the fact that inner class holds an implicit reference to the outer class, and hence preventing the outer class from GC'd. The solution lies in the warning itself that the class should be declared static. However, the solution is java specific. Given that kotlin has no modifier, the closest thing is companion object and companion object does hold reference to it's \"outer class\". Below are my [failed] attempts with remarks Are the assertion about attempt2 and attempt3 correct that even without the linter warning, the code is still leaking?
