I would make them separate... the issue here that in my view I use Pojo and in Repository is Entity all the way around. I solved this by converting Pojo to Entity and use entity elsewhere in the app(ViewModel->View->Adapter->ViewHolder) See the repository code below: Is this acceptable? What is the best practice for this? I have seen many examples with Room but none of them talked about this issue, they just put @Entity in the class and that's it. What about POJO how we use that Entity class if app uses POJO all the way around. How to insert a List into database? Do we do that object by object?
