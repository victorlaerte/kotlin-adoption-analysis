Background I need do design an Android application that as part of its functionality displays a real time scrolling raster plot (i.e. a spectrogram or waterfall plot). The data will first be coming out of libUSB and passing through native C++ where signal processing will happen. Then, I assume, the plotting can happen either in C++ or Kotlin depending on what is easier and whether passing the data over the JNI is a big enough bottleneck or not. My main concern is drawing the base raster itself in real time and not so much extra things such as zooming, axes, or other added functionality. I'm trying to start simple. Constraints I'm limited to free software. Platform: Android version 7.0+ on modern device GPU hardware acceleration is preferred as the CPU will be doing a good amount of number crunching bringing streaming data to the plot.

I am trying to get my head around the new MVVM recommended pattern and while it's really great to see something more \"standardized\" there are some things unclear. To have things in a simple way, let's have a brief sample. First, create the Entity Then create the DAO Then, I need to make the Repository. This is basically where my questions start. I see many examples, on official docs also using Dagger2. While I still struggle to fight with Dagger to proper understand dependency injection my question is, why do I need to use Dagger? I do understand that decoupling components allows easier testing, but is this necessarily for small projects? Why not interact between ViewModel, Repository, DAO directly without injection (maybe having classes passed on constructors)? As a side note, probably it's a good point to start with Kotlin. While I find it pretty cool I see that many parts of the official docs/guides still only have Java samples... So I kind of want to learn the new stuff with old Java but in the same time, since my previous projects was on javascript, the switch to kotlin wouldn't be that hard... "
