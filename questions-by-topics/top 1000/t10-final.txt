Unfortunately, I did it by renaming and moving the source folders rather than refactoring through Android Studio, which was a bad idea. I've been searching for a solution to this problem all day, and these are the things I have tried to no avail: Doing a Gradle sync; Reinstalling Java JRE and Java SDK; Reinstalling the latest version of Android Studio (1.4); Rolling back to the previous AS version (1.3); Invalidating the AS cache and restarting; Deleting the and directories in the project directory; Deleting the directory in my user directory; Running from the AS terminal; Manually copying the sources over to a new project (weird that it somehow persists across projects...) Things that I've tried with a little success, but only let me perform one more clean and rebuild before the error occurs again: Closing AS, manually deleting the build files and opening it again; Killing the process while AS is running (this could technically be done every time, but it's tedious and slows down the build process) So it seems that compile the Java process may put a lock on the build files for some reason, but it might also be something to do with Kotlin.

Feel free to offer any insight into this. Update 2: The last update isn't the cause. I found that if a project contains a Kotlin file then rebuilding and cleaning fails.

If I try to reference that same file from a Kotlin file in the main source set it complains that it can't see it (\"Unresolved reference\").

If I convert the Java file to Kotlin it works (and this is my current solution) but I'd like to know why it doesn't work since it's not always so easy to convert and it should work without converting. Based on my Googling it seems it's related to the source sets in Gradle but I don't want a separate Kotlin folder alongside the Java folder so I'm not sure I need this. Also, another project where I have both Java and Kotlin doesn't have this configured and works fine.

Currently the platforms I am targeting are Desktop (PC, Mac, Linux) via a platform independent jar and Android. The project is hosted at https://github.com/NoxHarmonium/project-whiplash Feel free to take a look if you need to. The bulk of the code is in a module called and is written entirely in Kotlin. This module is linked into both the Desktop and Android projects. This works fine for Android versions 7.1+ and for desktop. For all other versions of Android I get a pile of exceptions on anonymous functions such as this: Exception Sample: It seems to be caused by an incompatibility with the JVM that Kotlin targets by default (1.8) and the JVM level that older versions of Android support (1.6). I could be wrong but this explains why the latest version of Android works as it supports a later version of the JVM. The solution should be as simple as forcing Kotlin to emit JVM byte code as version 1.6 but I can't seem to work it out. If you compile Kotlin directly into an Android, this seems to be handled by using the Gradle plugin. Unfortunately I can't use this plugin for the core module because it should not have any Android dependencies. I tried to override the JVM version using the build settings mentioned at https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-gradle.html#compiler-options like this: However, it did not seem to work no matter which Gradle file I placed it in. In fact I get a \"Cannot resolve symbol 'kotlinOptions'\" error shown by Intellij when I try it. It is possible that the Kotlin team have changed something and the documentation has not been updated. I can override the Kotlin settings manually in the Intellij module settings but it gets overridden every time I sync the gradle project and is not a good long term solution. The project is designed to be IDE independent. Does anyone know how I could set up the core module for max compatibility with older versions of Android? I currently have the minimum API level set to 9 as this is the current LibGDX default but I'm willing to set this higher if it would be too difficult to target such a low API level. Edit 1: I just extracted the jar file produced by the core module and examined the class files using the tool. I ran the following command on a random class file and it output text with the following text using this question List of Java class file format major version numbers? I determined that the class file is actually targeting JVM 1.6. Therefore my original theory is wrong and there is another reason why older Android versions cannot load classes generated by Kotlin lambdas. "

When i jump into sources, the only thing I have is this : There is the same behavior for .jar and .aar files. I tried many things, like adding sourceSets in gradle file, create task in gradle to find sources and attach them to jar/aar and some others things i don't remember, but absolutely nothing worked. My question is this : What is the proper way to compile kotlin code (aar and jar) to make it debuggable Thank you by advance :) EDIT In order to create jar from java librairies, i used to execute this 2 gradle tasks : In the project, where i needed this library i was just creating a \"libs\" directory, in the app directory, and i was including it with this this line in gradle dependencies : I just found how to attach sources in android-studios. Now i can navigate threw sources for old kotlin librairies i made. To make that possible, I make \"Go to declaration\", and i choose sources on top right to navigate on my computer and choose the top folder of the library sources. I don't know if there was a change in android-studio or the compiler, but the jar creation does not work anymore (it fails with this :library:createJar NO-SOURCE). So even if i just want to make a library code only, i have to create an aar now. I'm happy to see i can debug both aar and jar files, but I just tried, even with \"F7\" it jumps randomly. I don't understand why? Another question. I made several librairies with code, integrated in a bigger aar library.

I'm compiling each extensions file (eg BitmapExtensions.kt) into a single file called 'Extensions' using : As a part of our company's IP policy I need to obfuscate the library via proguard before it makes it to any consumer project. I therefore need a proguard rule to keep these extension methods so that they are not thrown away. At first glance the below seems to work, inspecting the generated AAR's classes.jar shows that the extension methods still exist and their internals have been obfusecated. But when actually compiling in a consumer project, I get unresolved references to any extension method I've referenced. When I disable minification, the project builds correctly. How can I obfuscate my library and keep my kotlin extensions? edit: It appears that using on the entire package, and even specifying is not enough. The methods simply cannot be referenced in the consumer app. edit2: I believe I have narrowed this down to the file under /META-INF/ being removed when . This appears to be the ONLY difference between my minified and non-minified classes.jar. Something is removing this file... or preventing its generation. "

This solution provides me very nice advantages comparing to the other classic approach of having multiple Groovy written files per module (plus the root one) with their dependencies, parameters.

I've almost done everything (sync gradle, invalidate cache, remove cache, same gradle wrapper, etc) in my project to vanish those marks without any success. Here are some side questions: What am I doing wrong? What should I do to remove those red marks?

For this question we ignore the implications that renaming a method/function brings for invocations. To find the method/function to rename I am using a custom annotation and annotation processor. I have it working for the Java interface by following these instructions. I created a new project with three modules. The app module, annotation module and annotation processor module. The app module is an Android App and contains two separate Java and Kotlin interface files with one annotated method/function each. RenameJava.java RenameKotlin.kt The annotation module is a Java Library that only contains the annotation and we specify to only allow it on functions and we say it may only be visible in the source code. Rename.kt The annotation processor module is a Java Library that only contains the processor that iterates the elements that have the annotation and do transformations on them. RenameProcessor.kt Gradle files I added the following to the annotation processor : I added the following to the app : The annotation doesn't have dependencies besides the default generated ones. The reason we have different modules is so we can prevent the annotation and processor being build into the final APK since we only need those during building. Output The log shows the method in the Java interface was renamed: There was no log generated for the Kotlin interface. Indicating the annotation processor did not run. When you take a look at of the generated APK then you will see the following: You can see that the method of the Java interface has been renamed properly. While the function of the Kotlin interface has not. Even though it shows up in the log. You will also notice this warning in the log: So lets do what the warning suggests. Add to app and change to . After sync and rebuild the output is: Logs for the Java and Kotlin file are both appearing. Success you think? Looking at of the newly generated APK will make you think otherwise since both are in their original form: Question Is there a way to get the desired output in the final APK?

But then the error occurred again until I turn off the google service. It work until another error occurred. After google service was turned off, the missing class now is fabric class (I'm also using fabric). Then I took out all fabric library. Now the missing class is support.v7.appcompat.R$drawable. Weird thing is, whenever I do clean build on my project, the project smoothly. After some build, the ClassNotFoundException occurred again.

In non-Android Kotlin projects i.e. those using instead of , it is possible to simply omit the version from the dependency, which will then be automatically resolved from the plugin. This even works on non-Android modules within Android projects. My question is, why is this not possible in Android modules? Why can't the simply be omitted?

I want to print on screen source code from file A and if in the future i will make some changes in file A I want to print new state of this file . Let's assume that it's permissionable to print from file B or C (file A doesn't have to print itself). What is the most straightforward way to do this? TIP. From my research i think it's possible with gradle task, which fill copy files from src/main/java to assets before compilation. Than we can read these files from assets in \"standard\" way.

3780	q3780	0.40818799333170375 "Android and Web App sharing Kotlin code"," One of the major “selling” points of Kotlin appears to be its ability to compile both to JVM or Android and to JavaScript for the web. To make use of this, it should be possible to have a code base where some files are shared between an Android App and a browser Web App. However, so far I found little details on how such a thing would be set up, in particularly when working with Android Studio and its underlying Gradle setup, starting from a a run of the Android Studio New Project Wizard. I don't mind if I can only build the Web App on the command line, but I'd like to maintain the Android debugging hookups that Android Studio provides. So far I know very little about Gradle and typical idioms for its use. I'm sure that I'm not the first person to have this idea, so I'd like to know some best practices on how to set this up. Questions that come to my mind include the following: Do I mix the and the plugin in a single build file, or do I need to have multiple build files (perhaps I should say “modules” or “projects” except I don't know which)? If I have multiple build files, should that be two (one Android one Web) or three (one more for shared things)? If it is two build files, how do I reference the shared sources? If it is three build files, which plugin(s) do I use for the shared one? Do I need to split my sources over three different source trees? Are there any conventions how these should be called? Do I need to split my classes into three groups of packages, or can code for different targets coexist in the same package? What configuration settings do I need to tweak to make the IDE aware of the layout of my project? I've read the following relevant documentation, among other: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-gradle.html https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/intro_multi_project_builds.html https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/composite_builds.html https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/kotlin-android.html "
