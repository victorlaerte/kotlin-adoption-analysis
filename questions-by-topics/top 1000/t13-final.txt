To try and narrow down the problem I tried a couple of sample Anko projects, including android-anko-sample, and they all exhibit this same broken behavior. I have other Android projects I've written in Java, and they run without this problem, which suggests that this is somehow a Kotlin or Anko specific issue. I can even switch back and forth between one of my Java apps and the \"android-anko-sample\" app linked above, and reproduce the problem with android-anko-sample consistently, while my Java app works correctly every time. I have looked at other questions involving this error message, and the solutions posted were either not applicable or didn't help. One thing I have noticed that's weird is that when I open (of any of these Anko apps) in Android Studio the names of the activities are shown in red, as if they are errors. Here's how the one from android-anko-sample looks: Note that the app does get installed on the phone/emulator, and I can tap on the icon and run it. It just won't automatically start when I select run from Android Studio, which is pretty inconvenient. How do I fix this issue? I'm using: Android Studio 2.1.2 Ubuntu Linux 16.04 Oracle JDK 1.8.0_131-b11 Code is here: https://github.com/vsouhrada/android-anko-sample The complete contents of a few of Android Studio's panes are available in this gist: https://gist.github.com/xenomachina/e8027b385661038c3f020a543493eebf "
