After trying out some other build systems (like Buck for instance), performance is gained by splitting your code into multiple small modules. Some of the modern programming languages like Kotlin even have visibility modifiers specifically built around the concept of splitting your code into modules. We're currently at Gradle 2.14.1 (almost 3.0), and for the past several releases, they've quoted massive performance gains. With the changes to Gradle / the Android plugin the past few years, does it now produce faster builds to split your code into smaller modules, or to use fewer large modules? "

To make use of this, it should be possible to have a code base where some files are shared between an Android App and a browser Web App. However, so far I found little details on how such a thing would be set up, in particularly when working with Android Studio and its underlying Gradle setup, starting from a a run of the Android Studio New Project Wizard. I don't mind if I can only build the Web App on the command line, but I'd like to maintain the Android debugging hookups that Android Studio provides. So far I know very little about Gradle and typical idioms for its use. I'm sure that I'm not the first person to have this idea, so I'd like to know some best practices on how to set this up. Questions that come to my mind include the following: Do I mix the and the plugin in a single build file, or do I need to have multiple build files (perhaps I should say “modules” or “projects” except I don't know which)? If I have multiple build files, should that be two (one Android one Web) or three (one more for shared things)? If it is two build files, how do I reference the shared sources? If it is three build files, which plugin(s) do I use for the shared one? Do I need to split my sources over three different source trees? Are there any conventions how these should be called? Do I need to split my classes into three groups of packages, or can code for different targets coexist in the same package? What configuration settings do I need to tweak to make the IDE aware of the layout of my project?

I googled and read few answers as in how it is different from threads in terms of architecture and performance. Very well explained here, Difference between a "coroutine" and a "thread"? Fair enough, co-routines are great, no memory overhead, great performance, no dead-locks, race-conditions and etc. and easy to use. Now, here are few things, I am confused about and would like more clarity on the same - When should I use co-routines and thread in Android? Or should I stick with just co-routines? If, I just stick with co-routines then how it will take advantage of CPU-cores, as it runs on a single thread. Co-routines are great to use, but how it takes advantage of multiple cores for performance. "

My problem is probably my lack of experience (and understanding) of the Kotlin language. Nevertheless, I'll be needing help with this. I made a custom class, containing a custom function. It seems simple enough, but I keep getting the \"unresolved reference\" error when I try to use this function. This piece of example code reproduces the error: The error reads The class may not make a lot of sense like this, but it is intended to mimic the structure of the actual class I am using in my app. I feel I'm making a terrible rookie mistake. I've searched on Stackoverflow and Kotlin documentation, but I can't seem to find a solution. I tested the above code on try.kotlinlang.org, by simply replacing the \"hello world\" example. #### EDIT I'm afraid the context of the app I'm trying to build might be important after all. I'm trying to implement a Room database, but the clearest tutorial I could find is for Java, so I'm trying to translate and that makes me run into trouble. This is the page I'm currently following: Room Database. I need the \"Test\" class here to be a singleton, that's what the actual contents of \"getBla()\" were for. To get to actual problem, here's what the actual class looks like now: So needs to be a singleton. The problem arises from the automatic translation of Java code into Kotlin. It seems this situation is a bit too complex for that. I tried to find an answer by searching for various combination of \"Kotlin\", \"Singleton\" and \"abstract method\". Eventually I stumbled upon this blog: Kotlin singletons with argument. What I needed was a singleton that takes an argument, which apparently was not a trivial thing to do in Kotlin. This blog explains how to implement such a construct. My code now at least compiles, if it actually does what I want it to do I'll find out later. My current implementation is somewhat like this: SingletonHolder.kt (To build singletons taking arguments) BoxRoomDatabase.kt BoxRepository.kt Even though this compiles, it might not be the best way to go about doing this. If anyone has any input on the structure of the above code, feel free to share your input. "

2051	q2051	0.5178161997670595 "Clean Coroutines usage in Kotlin with Unit Test support"," Since a while we're working with Kotlin and one of the things we're currently focussing on is using Coroutines to take care of operations we want to run async. While the example usages are clear and that works, I'm having some issues integrating this in a clean manner within our architecture. When looking at a method's implementation for a domain-focussed class, the idea is that it's easy to read and there is as less \"noise\" as possible from async functionality. I know I can't have async, without actually using it. So writing something like this is what I'd like: But this is what I'd like to prevent: That, I'd like paired with practical Unit Tests for these domain-focussed classes, but I can't really get that to work. Let's look at an example: That works (screenshot: https://imgur.com/a/xG9Xw). Now lets look at the test. Now this test is less than ideal, but regardless, it never even gets to the point where it can verify things work as intended, because lateinit var data wasn't initialized. Now ultimately the aesthetics and readability of our domain classes is simply how far I want to go, which I have some practical working examples for that I'm happy with. But making my tests work seems to be challenging. Now there's some different write-ups online about this kind of stuff, but nothing has really worked out for me. This (https://medium.com/@tonyowen/android-kotlin-coroutines-unit-test-16e984ba35b4) seems interesting, but I don't like the idea of a calling class launching a context for a presenter, because that in turn has a dependency that does some async work. Although as an abstract thought I like the idea of \"Hey presenter, whatever you do, report back to me on a UI context\", it rather feels as a fix to make things work, leading to a shared concern for async functionality across different objects. Anyway, my question: Moving away from the short examples, does anyone have any pointers on how to integrate coroutines within a bigger architecture, with working unit tests? I'm also very open to arguments that make me alter my way of viewing things, given that's it's convincing on a different level than \"If you want things to work, you have to sacrifice.\". This question goes beyond just making the example work, as that is just an isolated example, while I'm looking for a real solid integration within a big project. Looking forward to your input.

The idea is that I tap a start button and the meter turns on, and when I tap a stop button the meter turns off.

I found noActivity() in the Android Developers docs, thinking that may be helpful, but I can't figure out how to use it properly nor can I find any good examples. The stop button is clearly on the page but this step is bypassed and it goes straight to tearDown(), which tells me that I'm not using it correctly or I don't understand what it's doing: So how do I overcome this? Is there an easy way to tell Espresso to not use idling resources for a certain test, or part of it? Do I need to write an idling resource that says when the stop button is found, the app is idle?
