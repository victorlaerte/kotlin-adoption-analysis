1683	q1683	0.6565950794081649 "Clean Architecture: Use different model classes for different data sources?"," I am currently developing a news feed android app. I try to design my app according to the principles of clean architecture. In the data layer I am using the repository pattern as a facade for the diferent data sources: remote data from an API (https://newsapi.org/) , local data from an DB (Realm or SQLite) as well as some in-memory cache. In my domain layer I have defined some immutable model classes (Article, NewsSource, etc.) which are being used by the domain layer as well as the presentation layer (no need for extra model classes in the presentation layer in my opinion). Does it make sense to use different model classes for the remote data source as well as for the local data source? E.g. The remote data source uses Retrofit to make API calls and the models need to be annotated in order to be parsed by GSON. The models for the local data source also may have to fulfill some certain contract like models in a Realm DB need to extend RealmObject. Obviously, I don´t want my domain models to be 'polluted' by any data source specific contract (annotations, RealmObject inheritance, etc.). So I thought it would make sense to use different models for different data sources and the repository handles the mapping between them. E.g. We want to fetch all articles from the remote API, store them in the local DB and return them to the domain layer. Flow would be like: Remote data source makes http request to news api and retrieves a list of ´s. The repository would map these models to a Domain specific article model (). Then these would be mapped to DB models (e.g. ) and inserted into the DB. Finally the list of ´s would be returned to the caller. Two questions arise: The above example shows how many allocations there would be using this approach. For every article that is going to be downloaded and inserted into the DB, three models would be created in that process. Would that be overkill? Also, I know that the data layer should use different model classes than the domain layer (inner layer should no nothing about outer layer). But how would that make sense in the above example. I would already have two different model classes for the two different data sources. Adding a third one that´s being used as a 'mediator' model by the data-layer/repository to handle mapping to other models (remote, local, domain) would add even more allocations. So should the data layer know nothing about domain models and let the domain do the mapping from a data layer model to a domain layer model? Should there be a generic model used only by the repository/data-layer? Thank, I really appreciate any help from more experienced developers :) "

In my case, I am unsure which approach is the best (if there is a best one) regarding the data layer and if the data layer should operate on its own model classes or if it may operate directly on the domain layer models. Also, if the data layer should operate on its own model classes, should data sources like or have their own models (like for an using and a model class with annotations) and then map to data layer models OR should the data layer model itself be the model returned by and (this means the data layer model must be annotated for being able to parse it in case of and ). This is the case in this project: https://github.com/android10/Android-CleanArchitecture/blob/master/data/src/main/java/com/fernandocejas/android10/sample/data/entity/UserEntity.java The following images should clarify the 3 approaches I mean: In Image 1 the and return specific model classes. In the case of the it may look like (using and ): These are then mapped by the Local/Remote data sources to models (which are used by the domain layer). Therefore the repository operates on domain layer models and is breaking boundaries right? That is approach 1. In Image 2 the and still return specific model classes. In the case of the it may look like (using and ): However, these models are then mapped to a data-layer model () which the data-layer operates on. When responding to the domain-layer the maps these ´s to the domain-layer model . This doesn´t break boundaries (right) but it needs some extra mapping in the data-layer. This is approach 2. In Image 3 the and already return the data-layer model . Therefore this model class must contain all annotations needed to parse the API request (with ): If the DB also needs some kind of annotations then these would have to be added to this class too (right?). An advantage of this approach I can think of is that there are fewer model classes (because DB and API directly map to data-layer models). However, doesn´t this blow up the data-layer model class with annotations/properties from all different data sources (DB, API)? Isn´t the whole point of abstracting the data sources from the repository violated then because the data-layer model is dependent on the specific data source implementation (e.g using Gson to parse API request with exact API response names). So this was approach 3. My question is: Which of the 3 approaches is the most flexible and future proof one? "

However, I am unsure of how to implement paging. By the way,.: I am using MVVM for my presentation layer. The View subscribes to the ViewModel´s LiveData. The ViewModel subscribes to RxJava streams. I came up with the following approach: The ViewModel subscribes to the Observable which emits data every time the underlying data in the database (SSOT) changes. However, my question is regarding the method. This method attempts to load more articles from the API and on success insert them into the local database. This causes to emit the new feed data. My questions: 1. Should the repository be responsible for syncing API and local database data? Or should the repository use some \"low-level\" API that manages syncing network/local data? 2. The method returns a which might seem weird/misleading. Are there better ways to indicate paging in the repository interface? 3. Paging means storing a current page count and use it when requesting data from the API. Where should the current page count be stored? In the repository? Or in some \"lower-level\" component that is being used by the repository? This repository is used to search articles. The method attempts to load more articles from the API depending on the last call to . For example: The ViewModel calls . A call to attempts to load more articles that contain the query string from the API and sync with the local database. Again my questions: 1. Is it OK to store information about the last request ( in the repository? I could also think of passing the request parameters in too, e.g. . This way the repository doesn't have to store information about the last request. 2. Again, returning a in might seem weird. Is this OK, or are there better ways? "

3787	q3787	0.6073521331831027 "Android repository-pattern & RxJava: Use Flowable or Single?"," Recently, I´ve read about how important it is to have a Single-Source-Of-Truth (SSOT) when designing an app´s backend (repository, not server-side-backend). https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/guide.html By developing a news-feed app (using the awesome https://newsapi.org/) I am trying to learn more about app architecture. However, I am unsure of how to design the repository interface for my app. Btw.: I am using MVVM for my presentation layer. The View subscribes to the ViewModel´s LiveData. The ViewModel subscribes to RxJava streams. So I came up with 2 approaches: Approach 1: This approach is primarily using Flowables which emit data if the corresponding data in the underlying SSOT (database) changes (e.g old data gets replaced with fresh data from API, more data was loaded from API, ...). However, I am unsure if using a Flowable for makes sense. As it is like some request/response thing, where maybe a Single might me be more intuitive. Approach 2: This approach is using Singles instead of Flowables. This seems very intuitive but if the data in the SSOT changes, no changes will be emitted. Instead, a call to the repository has to be made again. Another aspect to take into account is that the ViewModel may have to manage its own state. Let´s take the for example (pseudo-code). So this might not be crucial for a smaller app like mine, but it definitely can get a problem for a larger app (see state management: http://hannesdorfmann.com/android/arch-components-purist). Finally, I wanted to know which approach to take and why. Are there any best-practices? I know many of you have already done some larger software-projects/apps and it would be really awesome if some of you could share some knowledge with me and others. Thanks a lot! "

In my case i need to push SQL clause to ViewModel, which will do some magic and return Observable that will give me data I need. Everything works fine, but I am not sure if I am using RX in best way. My data flow: ViewModel has PublishSubject on which I am pushing SQL's. ViewModel has also Observable which is created by mapping subject. Also I used distinctUntilChanged on Subject, to prevent from executing same query again. To cache data I used replay(1).autoconnect(1) on Observable, but that approach had a flaw. Sometimes my Subject pushed Sql when Observable wasn't yet connect, and my data never arrived to me. Should I use BehaviourSubject? Or maybe i shouldn't use replay(1).autoconnect(1) in first place?

I have this SyncService class which calls series of different methods to send data to the server like the following: SyncService calls Sync Student, which calls Student Repository, which calls DataSource that makes a server request sending the data through Apollo's Graphql Client. The same pattern follows in each of my features: So every one of the method that I call has this signature: The problem is: When I sync and successfully save the Student on server, I need to sync his enrollment, and if I successfully save the enrollment, I need to sync another object and so on. It all depends on each other and I need to do it sequentially, that's why I was using callbacks. But as you can imagine, the code result is not very friendly, and me and my team starting searching for alternatives to keep it better. And we ended up with this extension function: But the function in DataSource still has a onSuccess() and onError() as callbacks that needs to be passed to whoever call it. The SyncService class code changed to be like: It does execute it sequentially, but I need a way to stop every other coroutine if any got any errors. Error that might come only from Apollo's So I've been trying a lot to find a way to simplify this code, but didn't get any good result. I don't even know if this chaining of callbacks can be simplify at all. That's why I came here to see some thoughts on it. TLDR: I want a way to execute all of my functions sequentially, and still be able to stop all coroutines if any got an exception without a lot o chaining callbacks. "

I'm not sure where I am going wrong. I'm followig MVP and also using some dagger injection for testability. In the view: The data source factory: The data source: And the view model: And the repository layer: The issue is I'm not getting an update to the view after the first page is loaded. I see this log from the onCreate(): but then after when the data source returns the items, I see these logs: BUT I never see the view that's subscribing to the view model get an update to set the list on the adapter.

Everything is working fine, I get the expected result when I request data. From the API class: From the main project which use this library, I get the user like this: All is working fine, but if an API error occurs, then the API send us for example: What I want is to provide explicitly this error to the front which get this error, because until now, when I get the error from the error Observable, the front can't parse this error I want to build. So my purpose is to parse this error from my library, build an Error POJO with the provided API json, and send it when the front get the error. If the error doesn't come from the API, then the front should get the normal error. "

The fragment receives the LiveData callback but the Activity does not (as proofed with breakpoints in debugging mode). What's weird is the Activity callback does trigger if I call the ViewModel's method. Below are the pertinent sections of the mentioned components: TabBarActivity EquipmentRecyclerViewFragment EquipmentViewModel The ultimate aim is to have the activity just observe the MutableLiveData boolean, but since that wasn't working I changed the activity to observe just the equipment LiveData to minimize the number of variables at play.
