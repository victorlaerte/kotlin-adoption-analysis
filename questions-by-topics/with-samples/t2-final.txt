However, if I send a long message (which takes about 3 seconds to print), The OutputStream.write function ends before the message gets printed.

I tested my app in a Lollipop device (API 22) and everything goes well. But since i need to test SourceAFIS library which targets API 24, I tested in a NOUGAT device. After requesting permissions for device, the app crashes but there is no error message that i can truly understand: I have tried permission requests at runtime to no avail. While debugging, the code reached a point where execution just stops, again, with no errors in logcat. Full Logcat: App Details: App consists of a state machine that, depending on callback received, it updates UI to enable/disable buttons. App can email the generated image (in png format). I did not find permissions required for this to work, but if anyone knows better, please inform. App saves images generated from sensor, so permission request is executed Since USB is used, \"android.hardware.usb.host\" feature is declared in manifest. In Lollipop device the only permissions listed in App info screen are \"modify or delete the contents of your USB storage\" and \"read the contents of your USB storage\" I'm using libusb library with the prebuilt .so files in armeabi and armeabi-v7a folders inside jniLibs directory. I discarded compatibility issues since while debugging device permission request is shown as granted, but if anyone knows better, I'll take any advice. Things I tried: Disable Hardware acceleration as suggested in this thread Request External Storage (read, write) permission at runtime Debug to see if there are any null values or procedural errors that might affect execution Add add permissions in Manifest and runtime requests Code (Kotlin): So far i haven't been able to find why it is working in lollipop and not in Nougat.

The problem I am having is that when my pdf is opened in the Xodo app and edited, it's not being saved to its original location, but rather a copy is saved to the Download folder. To me, this indicates that the app isn't able to save the edited file back to it's original destination, and I believe it's because I didn't do something right. Why do I think this?

But I'm completely lost. I am using Kotlin, and have gotten most of the functionality working by following the official documentation, but the end result just baffles me. I'm using the android.media.MediaRecorder class to record audio. What follows is basically the exact same code as shown in https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/mediarecorder, and it works. The two functions record a .3gp file and successfully save it to external storage. getDownloadsFolder is just my own function that finds the path to my phone's \"Download\" folder. But here comes the part that I don't get. I can't read the seemingly perfectly functioning sound files from said external memory. (And before you ask, yes, I do have permission to READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE.) It doesn't matter whether I use ACTION_PICK or ACTION_GET_CONTENT, the recorded sounds just aren't visible in the search results when I try to access them in the file system. Any other kind of sound file that's on my phone (downloaded from the internet or pre-installed on the phone) is available and can be selected, but the sound files that the MediaRecorder creates that DO EXIST (I can listen to them using a File Manager) are nowhere to be seen. And what really blows my mind is that if I manually create a copy of a recorded file, THE COPY can be found and read with the above method. Just... how? Shouldn't they be the same? "

I've been trying to get a Kotlin hello-world android.hardware.camera2 app working that takes high-quality pictures on a schedule for night-sky photography. This is my first foray into Android programming AND my first use of android.hardware.camera2, so I'm guessing I missed something silly. The laptop camera takes very dark pictures, but you can tell they are working when you manually lighten them up in post. However when run on a device (Pixel) the pictures are pure black. I thought I set up everything as full-auto mode, and waiting a second would allow the camera to focus, but maybe I need to wait a second after a preview is started? My best guess is that not having a live preview window is somehow unusual enough that it is messed up. "
